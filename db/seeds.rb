  {:title=>"The Only Thing To Fear", :date=>"2022-10-02", :summary=>"I run, and I think about being murdered.", :body=>"It’s late September, and stepping outside before sunrise no longer feels like stepping into a steam room, though I’m still stripped down to shorts and a sports bra.\n\nI wait for my watch to measure my heart rate, to find a GPS signal. It chirps at me when it’s ready.\n\nI run, and I think about being murdered.\n\n***\n\nWhen I think about it, all the bad things that could happen as I run through the city trails, I don’t feel especially panicked. The possibility, always catalogued somewhere in the back of my mind—along with things like a sudden heart attack, being hit by a car, falling and breaking my entire face—jostles along with me, sloshing in my brain with every step I take.\n\nStories like Eliza Fletcher’s bring the thoughts to the forefront, though.\n\nI know women who don’t run when it’s dark. Who don’t without mace, a dog, another person. Who don’t run outside at all.\n\nI don’t begrudge them or judge them; it would be wrong to say their fear is unwarranted. It’s very warranted. Completely warranted.\n\nI know the risks, but I don’t feel the fear.\n\n***\n\nIt’s 2016, and I’m in Vietnam, traveling by overnight bus from Halong Bay to Sapa. After many hours, we arrive at a bus stop, but my friend and I know we have longer still to go. Everyone else gets off, including the driver. No one says anything to my friend and I, so we stay put. The bus door closes.\n\nLong minutes pass. We have no idea what’s going on. True to form, I’m mostly concerned about going to the bathroom. (Three days of a diet I’m unaccustomed to have caught up with me.) My friend figures out how to open the bus doors. I run inside the stop, use the bathroom, and get back on the bus.\n\nWe wait more. Finally, a man appears, and he motions us off the bus. He speaks no English, and we speak no Vietnamese, so sign language has to suffice. We follow him to another bus, where more men are moving our bags to the luggage compartment.\n\nHe gestures for us to get on the bus.\n\nWe have no way of confirming that this bus will take us to our desired destination; we have no way of knowing that it’s safe.\n\nYet, we don’t hesitate. We board it, and by five in the morning, we arrive in Sapa, safe and sound.\n\n***\n\nWhy don’t I feel the fear?\n\nIs it because I’ve never had a close encounter, never been in a situation that I felt was dangerous? Is it my finely-honed, painstakingly-curated nihilism? Is it hubris, a false sense of invincibility? Is it a naive, subconscious belief that if my “vibes” are good enough, only good things will come?\n\nMaybe it’s all of the above.\n\n***\n\nSpiritual bypassing: A form of toxic positivity that tells us that, if we are “love and light,” our lives will be nothing but love and light. It’s big in New Age and holistic circles, but you can find it in Christianity, too—see prosperity gospel, or even the concept of being unironically “blessed.”\n\nI think it’s true that the attitudes, beliefs, and emotions that we carry with us impact our lives, both on a mundane level (no one wants to hang with Debbie Downer) and (I hope) on a deeper, karmic level.\n\nBut you can’t manifest not being raped and murdered.\n\n***\n\n“You run alone? You run in the dark?”\n\nFunny, how often these questions—questions that are really thinly-veiled scoldings—come mostly from other women. Mostly from older women. Women who won’t call themselves feminists. Women for Trump. Women invested in holding up the patriarchal system we live in.\n\nThe irony is: Even these women realize the inherent threat to womanhood. If they didn’t, they wouldn’t ask.\n\nThey don’t ask men these questions, after all. Men can run when they want, where they want, with who they want. (At least, they can if they’re white; the danger posed by white men is intersectional.)\n\n***\n\nEvery time I step outside to run, I know that there is a possibility—however slim, however remote—that it could be the last time I do. That I could be the next Eliza Fletcher.\n\nBut danger is everywhere. Freak accidents. Natural disasters. Mass shooters. Kidnappers in the Target parking lot, if the rumors are to be believed. I could be killed driving in my car, I could be murdered in a bar. It’s like a fucked-up Dr. Seuss book.\n\nEvery second, there’s a chance I could die. What scares me isn’t the danger of my run; what scares me is thinking about what will be said if that slim, remote possibility comes to pass, and I am the next woman to be featured in the headlines.\n\nShe shouldn’t have gone out in the dark.\n\nShe shouldn’t have gone alone.\n\nShe should have brought mace.\n\nShe should have been more covered up.\n\nShe shouldn’t have posted any of her route.\n\nShe should have gone on a more familiar route.\n\nShe should have taken a different route.\n\nI’m less afraid of something bad happening to me, and more afraid that I will be made to feel as though it is my fault.\n\nThe truth is: If a man wants to stalk, abduct, rape, or kill a woman badly enough, he will do it. He will do it, and he may be unsuccessful or brought to justice after the fact, but the women will still be the ones watching their backs. Looking over their shoulders. Staying on the alert.\n\nBeing scolded for what they could have done differently.", :image_url=>""},
  {:title=>"Entertainment For the End Times: The Best Stuff I Read, Watched, and Listened To in 2021", :date=>"2022-01-1", :summary=>"Here are the best things I read, watched, and listened to in a vain attempt to stave off my ever-growing sense of existential dread and detachment from reality. Enjoy them all now before it’s too late.", :body=>"Remember when people thought the world was going to end in 2012?\n\nCrazies! we said. Well—as it turns out, they were probably only a decade off, because surely 2022 is going to be the end. If the deadly ice storms don’t kill us, the wild fires will. And the survivors will be left to contend with whatever novel coronavirus variant happens to be ravaging the world at the time.\n\nI’m increasingly consumed with dark thoughts about how the Earth will likely give out before my body does, assuming I don’t die from a new, horrible strain of Covid.\n\nHere are the best things I read, watched, and listened to in a vain attempt to stave off my ever-growing sense of existential dread and detachment from reality. Enjoy them all now before it’s too late.\n\nBlack Buck (Mateo Askaripour)\n\nWritten from the point of view of the main character (the titular Buck), this book chronicles a young Black man’s rise from a Starbucks barista to a leading sales exec at a tech startup. Working sales-adjacent in tech, I found the setting semi-relatable, and the novel is simultaneously a fun, fast read and an insightful commentary on race. Without being heavy-handed, Askaripour does a great job of highlighting both the subtle—and unsubtle—racism that exists even in spaces liberal white people like to think of as “woke.”\n\nSuccession (HBO)\n\nSuccession is the ultimate nihilist television show. I started watching it on New Year’s Eve 2020 and its third season, which just finished airing, did not disappoint. It’s like Arrested Development meets Veep meets American Psycho. All the characters are super wealthy and super terrible and I can’t recommend it enough. It’s not a show you watch to root for the characters, but it shows us a world where the rich eat themselves and that’s what I’d like to manifest for 2022.\n\nRed (Taylor’s Version) (Taylor Swift)\n\nI like to say that 2020 is the year I became a Swiftie. I watched Miss Americana and you know? The propaganda worked. Then she released folklore and evermore and that’s how I ended up her in her top 2% of listeners. Her re-release of Red, in addition to including the masterful, 10-minute “All Too Well,” reminds us of the good times. Simpler times, before there was a motherfucking plague and before a steaming stack of shit in a skin suit destroyed our democracy. But Red’s re-release, which, ICYMI, gives Tay herself the profit from her music, also gives us hope that better things lie in front of us than lie ahead.\n\nThe Very Nice Box (Eve Gleichman, Laura Blackett)\n\nThe setting and theme of my other favorite book of the year is similar to Black Buck, but the books are very different tonally. The main character works at a trendy furniture company, where she’s a product designer. She has a tragic past, and, upon the book’s open, a new boss. This book is a bit of a thriller, but at its core it’s an examination of male entitlement.\n\nHadestown (Anaïs Mitchell)\n\nI realize this show came to Broadway and therefore mainstream popularity in 2019 but time hasn’t been real for like three years and not enough people are talking about how Anais Mitchell wrote “Why We Build the Wall” in the year of our lord two-thousand-fucking-six. 2006! This prophecy! It’s all about climate change and the evils of capitalism. It will stop being relevant only once the combination of these two things have completely eradicated humanity.\n\nThe Challenge (Paramount+, or MTV for you weirdos who still have cable)\n\nConfession: CT turning Johnny Bananas into a human backpack is the only thing that really brings me joy anymore.", :image_url=>""},
  {:title=>"A Long Blog About a Longer Race, Or: All About My First Ultra", :date=>"2021-08-22", :summary=>"I signed up for the race in December 2019 and promptly began training. But like everyone else, I had no idea what 2020 would hold.", :body=>"As has been well-documented, I like to run. I like to run so much that in 2019 I signed up for my first-ever ultramarathon.For the uninitiated: An ultramarathon is any distance longer than a marathon (which is 26.2 miles). Common ultra distances are 50k (31 miles), 50 miles, 100k, and 100 miles. While ultras can take place on the road or the track, they’re most commonly held on trails, which means they take even longer to complete since the terrain is hilly and highly technical (that’s a fancy way of saying there’s roots and rocks and shit).Lots of people have asked me why I would ever want to run an ultramarathon. I like to say that it’s all down to my willingness to do nearly anything to foster a misplaced sense smug superiority.But if I’m being real, there’s a little more to it than that. I haven’t PRed in the half-marathon since 2016. After a grueling 2019 Good Life Halfsy where I missed a PR by about 30 seconds, I was ready to stop thinking about speed and start looking for another challenge.After reading a slew of running books in 2018 and 2019, most of them about athletes like Scott Jurek and Rich Roll and Dean Karnazes, I started dreaming about joining the ranks of the ultrarunners. So I did a little research, and one ultra that was “close” to home and ranked on several “good first ultra” lists was the Dirty 30 in Colorado’s Golden Gate Canyon State Park—32 miles and more than 7,600 feet of climbing. I signed up for the race in December 2019 and promptly began training. But like everyone else, I had no idea what 2020 would hold.The one nice thing about the “unprecedented times” of March 2020 was that my primary hobby—running alone in the woods for literal hours—was unaffected. I ran my highest-ever mileage week (52 miles) in May 2020, and I was feeling good, doing 20-plus-mile long runs out on mountain bike trails. Not that it mattered, in the end. The 2020 Dirty 30 was among the many causalities of the pandemic. So I spent a summer licking my wounds, and when registration for the 2021 race came around, I took advantage of my cancellation discount and signed up again. I got off to a decent start with my second round of training, even managing a very slow, 11-mile run on iced over trails in the first four weeks. But the night prior, my husband had come home from teaching not feeling well. It could have been anything—he could have just been tired—so we didn’t think too much of it. At least not at first.Three days later, he realized he couldn’t taste the Impossible burgers we made for dinner, and I was starting to feel a little off myself, something I tried to attribute from the chill of running through three feet of fresh snow earlier that morning. But in the middle of the night, I woke up sweating and feverish. In the next two days, we both tested positive for Covid.We had mild cases, which meant we both felt like shit for a solid two weeks. (This is your reminder to get the damn vaccine if you haven’t.) I took another week off running, per all the no doubt highly-scientific advice I found on Runner’s World, then got back to it.My first post-’rona run was three miles, usually an easy distance I could run in 25–27 minutes without pushing too hard. But this time, it took me a solid 30 minutes, and that didn’t include the times I had to stop and wait for my heart rate to go down. It was pumping so hard it was like I’d been running a much longer distance at a much faster pace. In total, it took five weeks before I even approached pre-Covid mileage, to say nothing of pre-Covid pace. I got vaxxed on Fridays at the end of March and April, and a side effect was a day or so of muscle soreness that didn’t do anything to help my training the next day. In the end, my longest run prior to the race was only 16 miles—half of the total distance. At this point, I’d adjusted my goal from “finish in under 10 hours” to just “finish, period” because despite my many setbacks and my lackluster training, I was still determined to do the race or die trying, though, as usual, I was less afraid of dying and more afraid of shitting my pants in the attempt. Come race day, I had never been so nervous and anxious, which is saying a lot for someone with unmedicated generalized anxiety disorder. My strategy was to take it aid station by aid station and focus on making the cut-off times. (The overall race cut off time was 11 hours and 30 minutes.) I knew if I thought about the whole distance, I would completely fall apart. My husband drove for an hour through windy mountain roads in the dark to get me to the starting line. I spent about an hour trying to gauge if I could poop any more and shivering in the cool morning air, then I lined up with the other first-wave runners.We got off to a rough start when some of our group—anywhere from 20 to 50 people—took a wrong turn and ran about a quarter mile in the wrong direction before getting back on track. It was unfortunate, but I was just glad I wasn’t lost out on the trail alone, something I had spent a significant amount of time worry about. As I ran a nice downhill single track path somewhere around the third mile, I got hit with what would the be first of many waves of emotion throughout the day. Even though I still had many miles to go (29, to be exact), even though I was currently being passed by a runner much more fit, I was just feeling the weight of the anxiety lifting. No matter what happened, after today, it would all be over.Things went smoothly until mile nine, at which point I wiped out. Though the course had many treacherous downhills filled with loose, chunky rocks, I was running on a gravel flat when I tried to move aside for a runner coming up behind me and fell in the process. Embarrassment alone motivated me to get up and stumble on, but seconds later I became lightheaded. My vision blurred. Stupidly, I kept running anyway, and through dumb luck I stopped feeling like I could pass out at any moment. A few minutes later, when I was crossing a bridge, I looked down and saw just how much my knee had bled. Suddenly the dizziness made sense. I stopped in my tracks, slightly horrified. Another passing runner—an older but very fit man—stopped to make sure I was okay. He gave me a little pep talk before he took off again, and I pushed on to next aid station at mile 12. At the aid station, a volunteer helped me wipe off the wounds with a wet paper towel before applying Neosporin. An attempt was made at wearing some Bandaids, but they didn’t last long before the combination of ointment and sweat had them sliding off. That was hardly the worst of it, though. I was quite literally climbing over rocks on my way to the next aid station, and I’d gone to a dark place mentally. I was already exhausted, and at this point the race was becoming more of an ultrahike than an ultrarun. A race photographer appeared, and he asked me how it was going. I mumbled something to the effect of “oh, it’s going,” but he heard me say, “not so good,” which was far more accurate. After he took some pictures of my bloody knee and palm, he told me it was all downhill to the next aid station, and he said he hoped I felt better soon. Heartened, I continued on my way.It did not feel downhill to the next aid station, but I made it all the same. It was mile 17.something, and a lot of people were trying to quit at this point. But the volunteers at this station were determined not to let anyone drop for anything less than a life-threatening injury. As I sat trying to choke down as many boiled potatoes as I could stomach, I heard one woman tell a runner, “if it’s just your stomach that’s bothering you, you can keep going. Have some ginger ale.” Before I left the aid station, another volunteer doused my wounds with hydrogen peroxide and applied a moleskin bandage to my knee.  That, too, was short lived, and by mile 20, I’d accepted it: There would be blood. I was many hours in at this point, and time started passing strangely. I had the surreal experience of looking at my watch, seeing I was eight hours in, and wondering where the time had gone.During the last third of the race, I leapfrogged with a girl named Alison from Boulder—I’d get a burst of energy and jog past her, and then I’d slow to walk and minutes later she’d pass me, until eventually it turned into us walking together until one of us wanted to stop and pant for breath. It was her first ultra too, and she asked if there was lots of “vert” (read: elevation gain) in Nebraska. I said no, and she said, “Well, I’m sure there are other ways to train.” Given my performance up to this point, I was thinking that was clearly not the case. I wasn’t familiar with the course, but I knew the biggest climb of the race was Windy Peak. At mile 25-ish, I thought we’d already finished it, but Alison said it was still to come. I didn’t entirely believe her until we’d been going uphill for awhile, and we started seeing runners pass us coming back down the way we came. On her way down, one woman saw our green first-timer bibs, and she said, “Way to you you two. I’m so proud of you for doing this.”Alison looked at me and said, “Wow, I’m about to cry.”And honestly, so was I. At this point, even the race signs with lame motivational quotes like, “if it doesn’t challenge you, it doesn’t change you” were making me tear up. I made it to the top of Windy Peak alone, and then there were just a few miles left. I even managed to run the last quarter mile—quite an accomplishment, because I’d almost certainly done more walking than running. I crossed the finish line 11 hours and nine minutes after I’d started. As a volunteer put a finisher’s medal around my neck, I was flooded with the same sense of gratitude. Gratitude for all my friends and family who’d been understanding when I couldn’t stay out late on Fridays because I had my long run the next morning, who’d texted me well-wishes the night before and the morning of. Gratitude for my husband, who gave up three days to stay with me in Colorado while I acclimated, and spent two hours just getting me to the race and back. Gratitude for the volunteers, who made sure I ate and got speedy water refills and medical attention. Gratitude for the other racers, who all went out of their way to offer commiseration and encouragement. And I was also proud. Not necessarily of my performance—I finished 346 out of 366, after all—but of everything that led up to it. Every day I got up to run in the ice and the snow, in the heat and humidity, every minute I kept going during the actual race, I made a decision. I made a decision to show up for myself. Throughout my training, I realize it’s true what the philosophers say: Some things are just intrinsically valuable. A faster mile, more muscled legs, finisher medals—all amazing things, but all less important than the work you do on yourself in the process of getting them. And the best part? I didn’t even shit my pants.

Everyone agrees that Trump is divisive. But not everyone agrees that he’s a fascist, and if you still don’t, I’m not likely to convince you, but all of Laurence W. Britt’s fourteen indicators of fascism have been met. Trump is a fascist. If you voted for him, if you supported him, you are by default a fascist. It doesn’t matter if you “just like his stance on the economy.” You think rich people getting more tax cuts is more important than…democracy. As A.R. Moxon said: Historians have a word for Germans who joined the Nazi party, not because they hated Jews, but out of a hope for restored patriotism, or a sense of economic anxiety, or a hope to preserve their religious values, or dislike of their opponents, or raw political opportunism, or convenience, or ignorance, or greed.That word is \"Nazi.\" Nobody cares about their motives anymore.I am very, very sick of being gaslit by the “both sides” people and all of their whataboutism. There is a literal fuck-ton of photographic evidence highlighting the difference in the treatment of Black Lives Matter protestors and the Trump insurrectionists.Even if the BLM protests had been nearly as violent (spoiler: they were not) as the mob at the Capitol, the BLM protestors were protesting Black peoples’ right to not be murdered by police. A few protestors threw water bottles at police, and they were tear gassed. The insurrectionists were very literally trying to stop elected officials from certifying a fair and free election. These people came into the nation’s Capitol with guns and Molotov cocktails and zip ties and the police response was so lacking that there’s now speculation as to whether Capitol police were actually in on the coup. (This is a terribly disturbing possibility, so I’m trying not to dwell on it until it can be better proven, but I certainly can’t discount it.)“Let’s all agree to disagree” is good in theory. There are lots of things I’m willing to agree to disagree about. Serious issues of morals, ethics and beliefs, such as “eating meat is unethical,” “God doesn’t exist,” and “the Star Wars sequel trilogy ended up being a colossal disappointment.” If you eat meat, believe in God, or liked The Rise of Skywalker, I think you are wrong, but we can still be friends. We can agree to disagree, because your views are not inherently undemocratic. But if your belief is “agents of the state (AKA cops) can act with impunity” or “sowing doubt about an election you lost is acceptable” or “corporations have more rights than individuals,” I am not going to agree to disagree. I am going to lose all respect for you, tell you so, and cut you out of my life as much as I feasibly can. If we tolerate fascists, we are going to get fascism. The real question is not “should we tolerate fascists” but rather, “how do we deal with fascists in a democratic society?” John Marshall wrote: Nor do I think all views deserve a right of equal hearing in a democratic society. Philosophies that seek to destroy democracy and the rule of law don’t merit equal validation by a democracy. We grant them certain rights because doing so is consistent with a larger system of laws and rights that guarantees a civil society that is the antithesis of what they believe in. While, according to Marshall (and also me), fascists deserve to get punched, it’s not always the correct course of action—both for practical and ethical reasons. The people responsible for the coup attempt should be held accountable lest this kind of response to unfavorable political outcomes escalate. (Parables to the Beer Hall Putsch abound.) There are many, many complicit parties, but Trump is the undeniable instigator, the man all of these crazy motherfuckers are ready to sacrifice democracy for.While Trump has often been accused of inciting violence (and he 100% has), his words haven’t met the legal definition of incitement—or at least they hadn’t, until he told his followers to protest in D.C. on January 6 and to “be wild,” and instructed them to “fight like hell” on that day. Unfortunately, it seems pretty unlikely that any case against Trump in the matter of the insurrection will ever even make it to the Supreme Court, and less likely a court packed with his picks would agree that his words didn’t fall under the Brandenburg test.But while we have to (paradoxically) protect peoples’ legal right to hold fascist beliefs and say fascist things as part of democracy, we do not have to respect it—and certainly not at an interpersonal level.The insurrection certainly broke the laws of our democracy, and some of the people involved (though likely not those most responsible) will suffer legal consequences (but probably not enough). Of course that’s important. And perhaps more importantly, they’ll also face non-legal consequences as well, including losing their jobs, because most companies are smart enough not to employ a guy who’s been photographed wearing a Camp Auschwitz hoodie.Ultimately, those consequences will be just as deterring as legal consequences. We can’t always rely on the law to give these people what they really deserve; after all, asking the state to round up all the fascists and put them in jail would be…fascism. That’s why we need to lean into the power of societal consequences—both to shut down the people actively trying to thwart democracy, and the people enabling it from the sidelines. Our society is governed by cultural norms just as much as it’s governed by actual government. So let’s make being a fascist a societal taboo. Let’s make it a cultural norm to tell any espousing or enabling inherently anti-democratic ideals to shut the fuck up. We can refuse to agree to disagree with people who think protesting for racial equality is equivalent to halting the democratic process using armed force. We can make them uncomfortable by calling them out. We can refuse to socialize or do business with them. My stance on this is the same as it was four years ago. People who recognize the threat of fascism need to stop humoring it on an interpersonal level. If you tolerate it, you enable it. Remember, kids: It’s never a bad time to cut off the fascists and fascist enablers in your life. Fuck “both sides,” fuck civility politics, and fuck fascism.

Uncertain, unexpected, unprecedented, unsettling, unwelcome. A pandemic the likes of which we’ve never experienced is all of the above, but mostly it is uncertain.Uncertainty is disconcerting. Even people who worship at the altar of last-minute plans want something they can rely on. What can you be sure of you if you can’t be sure that Starbucks will open, that Wal-Mart will have toilet paper, that you can visit your parents, that the hospital will have a bed for you? First: You can be certain there will be loss. Loss of human life is the most certain and the most painful. It will take the form of grandparents and elderly neighbors, of those already living with a disease or illness, for certain, but it will also include the young, healthy and fit, the people who would have never imagined they were at risk. And there will certainly be loss that doesn’t fill up graves, but still depletes the spirit. Many of these losses will take the form of cancellations. Casualties include:The musical you had tickets to. Dear Evan Hansen, now we’re all waving through the window. The race you’ve been training for (since December).Your family vacation to the mountains—canceled nearly two months ahead of time. Your best friend’s wedding reception (a party for 600, postponed to four months later).Graduations, concerts, sports, funerals, parties—these are also victims of uncertainty. You grieve the losses, then you accept them. After so many—and after so many that make yours pale in comparison—you can handle small losses to avoid larger ones. Fear is harder to handle. Pregnant women fear they’ll deliver their babies alone, without the support of their family or partner. Teachers fear for their students, that the ones who rely on school meals will go to bed hungry. Small business owners—restaurants and coffee shops, bars and venues, salons and gyms—fear their business will not withstand another business-less week. You fear, too. You fear you will be sheltering at home for months. You fear the economy will completely collapse and you will lose your job. You fear what could be happening under the public’s nose, what politicians are sneaking into law or which regulations they’re rolling back while you look the other way. You fear someone you know will get sick. You fear you will get sick. You fear you or someone you know will be hospitalized. You fear fear they’ll need a ventilator. You fear there won’t be a ventilator. You fear life will never go back to normal. You fear the weight of your fear will crush you.So, take note: You can be certain you will be afraid. You will have to distract yourself from the fear. First, you’ll try to throw yourself into work. When that fails, you’ll seek out news articles, rational explanations from people smarter than you. When that intensifies your anxiety, you’ll turn to entertainment, everything from books and TV to games and movies. When those bore you, you’ll look for ways to add novelty to sheltering at home with new hobbies—baking, gardening, crafting. When you need to talk to another human, you can text and video conference and Netflix party, a privilege unavailable to those who lived through pandemics past. But when nothing completely eradicates the nagging anxieties that keep you up late and give you a fitful night’s sleep, you will have only one thing left to do. From the Black Death to the AIDS epidemic, it’s all we’ve ever been able to do.

I know there’s a lot of unacceptable bullshit going on right now that is unarguably more important than a not-even-that-popular Netflix series, but if we can’t turn to pop culture in these dark times, what do we even have left?Besides, anyone whose mouth isn’t surgically attached to Trump’s asshole like the world’s crustiest, whitest human centipede knows how fucked what’s happening on Capitol Hill is. What people don’t know (or perhaps are just too afraid to say?) is how in three short seasons, The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina has gone from a very solid show full of promise to pure, nonsensical chaos.Let’s recap:From the creators of Riverdale (which I’ve never seen, but is apparently also batfuck insane) came a dark ‘n’ edgy reboot of Sabrina the Teenage Witch, released just in time for Halloween 2018. While it didn’t have the expert, genre-bending mix of action, suspense, teen drama and humor like my all-time-fave, Buffy, it was interesting enough to merit a watch of the second season.Was the second season worth a watch of the third season? Arguably no. While the season starts out all right and has some strong moments mid-season, things really go downhill fast: First, Sabrina is the anti-christ. Then she’s actually the devil’s daughter and she’s supposed to be the queen of hell, which Lucifer (who, natch, has washboard abs) tells her himself. Then she and her coven perform “Masquerade.” Yes, from Phantom of the Opera. If only I had seen the season three music video before I started watching, I would have never made the attempt. But alas, I only noticed this abomination after we’d made it a few episodes in, and at that point, like  the titular character herself, we were already too far into hell to turn back.(Click the link. Watch the video. It’s like watching “Let’s Go To the Mall” happen IRL.) Since this show has an inexplicably high critic score on Rotten Tomatoes, I feel duty-bound to lay out all the reasons this TV show is absolute garbage.It’s tone deaf.While the first season nearly achieved American Psycho-levels of dark humor, it’s completely lost it by season three. Is the scene where Sabrina’s cheerleading squad performs “Hey Mickey” at her witch school so the coven can sap their energy meant to be funny? Meanwhile, opportunities for a heavier tone are completely blown—Sabrina’s boyfriend, Nick, spends the first few episodes with the devil’s body inside him (you see?). After Lucifer is moved to another humanly host, Nick’s possession serves as a very messy, insensitive rape allegory, which other students at the witch school mock him for. Character motivations are incomprehensibly fickle.You never know what’s going to happen in this show, because you never know how a character will respond in any given scenario. Fun, right? This season introduces a character named Caliban, who, like Nick and Lucifer, is often shirtless. He’s a prince of hell and his one distinguishing trait is that he’s made of clay—something we’re constantly reminded of since he tells us “I’m made of clay” at least once an episode. He challenges Sabrina’s claim to the throne of hell—because despite being, excuse the pun, hellbent against ruling the underworld at the end of last season, Sabrina agrees to it with zero hesitation during the first episode in order to save Nick. She and Caliban are pitted against each other in a MacGuffin quest, but when one of her friends is turned to stone, the hunky hellion offers to help her and proposes an alliance via marriage. Why? We have no idea. Presumably he’s just that hot for Sabrina—as one sane critic pointed out, this show is inexplicably and disconcertingly horny. World building is sloppy. If only the writers were less fixated on on making uncomfy “daddy” jokes (yes, these all have to do with Lucifer being Sabrina’s father while also inhabiting her boyfriend’s body) and more intent on doing coherent world building! From the first season, we’ve known the witches in the show are, like, Christians, but make it Satan—something that was never my favorite aspect of the show and became even more uninteresting in season two, which exposed us to more inner workings of the Church of Night, including the “anti-pope.” (Yawn.) Still, it would follow that witches view hell as their ideal afterlife, right? Apparently not! Hell is seemingly made up of only Biblical characters and one of Sabrina’s mortal friend’s uncles. And even though hell is actually pretty easy to get to (Sabrina pulls it off in the first episode, accompanied by her mortal friends), most witches have never been. It gets weirder when we’re introduced to the pagans, who are actually this season’s main villain. (Satan is reduced to a role on the sidelines, cheering Sabrina on as she half-heartedly fights for rule of hell.) It’s unclear how the “old gods” the pagans are trying to resurrect fit in with the devil and the “false god” the witches refer to. (It become even less clear when one of said pagans reveals himself to be “the great god Pan.”) The season’s cliffhanger ends with the resurrection of an eldritch terror, adding more confusion to the supernatural hierarchy. Sabrina herself is unlikable. Possibly the biggest issue with The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina is that its titular character is so stupid and shallow. Sabrina is constantly betrayed by Caliban and other enemies in incredibly obvious setups this season, and each time she acts surprised that someone who goes by “the prince of hell” would backstab her.The only thing more annoying than her obliviousness is her vapidness. Soon after she gets the devil/her father out of her boyfriend’s body, she’s on his ass to go to her pep rally. (Because she joined the cheer team. Why? See: “fickle character motivations.”) On the surface, it would be easy to draw comparisons to Buffy, but that would be lazy and incredibly insulting to Buffy Summers. For Buffy, cheerleading was part of her normal teen life before she was called to be the Slayer, and she doesn’t want to give it up—but she still spends most of her high school career sacrificing those things for saving the world. For Sabrina, who has literally never professed an interest in it and always seemed a little too edgy for it, cheerleading just seems like a way to work in musical numbers in a show that doesn’t really support it. (Also, Buffy certainly didn’t nag Angel about going to the carnival with her when he got back from hell.) Ultimately, am I more disappointed in The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina showrunners, or the Republican party? Definitely the former—the show at least had a chance of being good. ", :image_url=>""},

Can’t get enough! I thought a lot of the “best of 2019” books like Doxology, The Water Cure, The Female Persuasion, Normal People and, most notably, Trust Exercise were just so-so. There were exceptions, like The Farm and We Cast a Shadow, but my key takeaway is not to buy the hype.Is it just me, or are books featuring open marriages, teacher-student affairs or women who have a lot of casual sex to mask their pain and/or loneliness getting a little long in the tooth? Between the nonfictional Three Women and the memoir Unwifeable to all the novels I read featuring one or more of these, it just became sort of a downer. And while Three Women and Unwifeable get a pass because, you know, real life, I’m just bored with all of these stories in fiction since they so rarely have anything new or particularly poignant to say. I am officially too old for YA. I read two young adult novels—Emergency Contact and Odd One Out—and suffered through both. So, of the 60 books I read in 2019, which are get the metaphorical Hannah Book Club seal? The Indifferent Stars Above: The Harrowing Saga of a Donner Party Bride, Daniel James BrownI am not an audiobook or podcast person—I hate listening to talking, probably because I would generally prefer to be the one speaking. But when my husband and I drove to Austin, Texas last February, we needed some shared entertainment since our musical tastes are too at-odds to withstand a 12-hour car ride. Friends had recommended this book. Since it was exactly 12 hours, so we gave it a shot, then spent the next few months talking about the Donner Party and only the Donner Party at dinner, drinks, parties and weddings, which I’m sure has done great things for our social standing. I’ll warn you, it starts off slow as Brown gives an abundance of backstory and painstakingly sets the scene. (If I had been reading the book, it’s like I’d have skimmed the first bit of it, but that’s a little more difficult to pull off with an audiobook.) Just as we were beginning to wonder out loud when people were going to start eating each other, things got good. I learned from this book—not just about the Donner Party, but about snow blindness, hypothermia and the larger historical context of the movement West. This book is harrowing but it’s absolutely fascinating. Room, Emma DonoghueI devoured this book, starting it one evening and finishing it the next morning. Then I watched the movie (which starts the amazing Brie Larson and is very well done). Similar to The Indifferent Stars Above, it’s the type of book that just sticks in your head—and as a work of fiction it’s a tremendous feat. I also read Emma Donoghue’s newest work, Akin, which was very, very good and completely different from Room in both tone and premise (though both books do feature an adult and child essentially stuck with each other). Mad props to this women for being able to write so expertly from the point-of-view of a five-year-old boy and an 80-year-old man. Initiated: Memoir of a Witch, Amanda Yates GarciaMost of my books come from the library, but when it was the week of Halloween and I saw this on display at my local bookshop, I had to snag it. This was an impulse buy without regret. Written by a professional witch (it’s a thing!), the book is personal, political and mythological all at once. Even if you, like me, have no experience with spell casting, this book is a magical feminist manifesto. Shoe Dog: A Memoir by the Creator of Nike, Phil KnightAnd now for something completely different—a business memoir! By a MAN! Hear me out, though. Shoe Dog is a truly fascinating read, because the Nike we know today is certainly not the Nike of the 60s. It is absolutely wild to read how the company was started, with an origin story that seems completely impossible in today’s era. If you’re interested in sports, business or history, this is a great read, and if you like all three, even better. The Power, Naomi AldermanThe one-sentence pitch I served up a co-worker for this book: “The Handmaid’s Tale, but opposite.” I don’t know about you, but it’s 2019, and I am here for men’s subjugation. (At least in fiction, but think it could be worth a shot IRL…) The comparisons to The Handmaid’s Tale are unsurprising, given the author’s relationship with Margaret Atwood. This book-within-a-book follows multiple characters’ stories, which I almost always enjoy as it keeps things feeling fresh. While the premise is interesting enough on its own, I think it’s the execution and style that made this book such an entertaining and powerful (seewhatididthere) read.Here’s to a new year and new books! If you have recommendations—particularly for memoir—send ‘em my way. ", :image_url=>""},
  {:title=>"Hamsters I Have Loved", :date=>"2019-09-10", :summary=>"I was in second grade when Santa brought my little brother and I the best present any kids could wish for: living creatures.", :body=>"I was in second grade when Santa brought my little brother and I the best present any kids could wish for: living creatures.Up until then, the pet roster had been limited to Marie, the stray cat I convinced my parents to let us keep, and Shere Khan, a tiger salamander. Marie spent half her time outdoors and the other half spurning any human contact, and we only had Shere Khan for nine months before we set him free in the Camp Jefferson lake. (Was it because we genuinely believe he’d be happier in that moss-infested pond, or did my parents just get sick of feeding him raw meat and a cleaning a tank that “stunk to high heaven”? Take a guess.)Needless to say, the pets I kept during my first eight years of life weren’t exactly top-tier, but all that was about to change, because Coleman and I were now in possession of highest caliber animals $20 can buy: dwarf hamsters. The Petco people assured my par—er, Santa, the hamsters were the same sex. They knew this, somehow, without actually knowing what that sex was. (As we would learn later, they actually knew neither of these things.) This mystery led us to choose gender-neutral names for our hamsters. Mine, tan and slightly red-eyed, was Sammy. Coleman’s, gray and white, was Charlie. Sammy was quite the escape artist. One of my most vivid childhood memories is coming to their cage and lowering the hamster elevator and coming through the litter, only to find no trace of Sammy. (The hamster elevator was a soup ladle we used to scoop the up hamsters from the cage without being bitten.) A day-long search party commenced. I was despaired of the potential loss of my beloved pet; my parents despaired of said pet’s eventual stench as it died and decomposed within our the walls of our home. I had this old skeleton key that was one of many treasures from my great-grandmother’s house. She’d told me that it was magic—that if I held it tight enough and believed hard enough, it could answer a wish. I was very careful not to abuse the key’s power and didn’t wish for anything until Sammy went missing and I wished for his/her safe return. I also prayed to god, but in what was perhaps a harbinger of my future faithless-ness, I gave all thanks to the magic skeleton key when we found Sammy hiding in the dollhouse in my closet. (If you think that sounds cute as hell, you’re right.) Years later I’d learn the Sammy that went missing that day was actually Sammy II. Sammy I’s escape had a much grimmer ending—death at the paws of Marie. Rather than use this a teaching moment about the food chain and the ruthlessness of life, my parents pulled a classic switcheroo on me.Hamster mania had swept the Bauer household, so Sammy and Charlie got a roommate. At some point we’d become convinced they were boys and selected their new companion, Harvey, accordingly. It’s important to note that the Petco people told us he was male. It’s also important to note that Petco employees are no better suited than you or I to determine a tiny rodent’s gender based on its invisible-to-the-human-eye genitalia. Charlie and Harvey kept fighting. Specifically, Charlie kept fighting with Harvey—he was always the instigator of the violence that led to the crazed squeaking as Harvey writhed beneath him. Some keen readers may have picked up on my very subtle foreshadowing and realized what pre-pubescent me did not: Charlie was not fighting Harvey. Charlie was either raping or making sweet-but-kinky love to Harvey, and I think we all know it was probably the first one. Did my parents know? They gave no indication they thought it was anything other than fighting, but then again, how do you tell your 10 and six-year-old kids one of their pets is sexually assaulting the other? We placed little plastic dividers in the tunnels of their palatial cage to block off sections and give Harvey the chance to go unmolested, but the single water bottle necessitated shared living space. It was so mystifying to us that it was always just Charlie and Harvey “fighting,” never Sammy. (#NotAllHamsters.)The truth came out one day when I peeked in on the cage before school. Harvey was up in the tower,  and beside him was what appeared to be his own entrails. As my mom and brother came running, I took a closer look and realized that the fleshy pink thing next to Harvey wasn’t his guts, but his progeny. Harvey was a girl hamster, and she’d given birth. Even though we couldn’t tell the difference between hamster fighting and hamster fucking, we all knew they usually had litters. Were more babies on the way? No, but we were about to get that much-delayed lesson about the brutality of animals. Upon inspection, we saw that the bars of the bottom of the cage were bloody. We (read: my mom) immediately assumed Charlie ate the other babies. Dark, right? But guess what! It gets darker, because thanks to 10 minutes of research (read: Googling it), I know now that the father hamster doesn’t eat its young—the mother hamster does. Because she’s stressed or sick or because the father, her rapist, is still in the cage. Dark! So! Fucking! Dark! So why did Harvey spare the lone baby in the tower? Because she was dead. I realized with distress that she wasn’t breathing, and I asked my mom just how we were going to take care of this little baby, which we named Pinky for its defining characteristic. The answer, she said with regret, was that we weren’t. Coleman and I were shuffled off to school and my dad came home over lunch to euthanize Pinky by putting him/her in our garage freezer. (Seriously, this is some sack-of-King’s-Landing-level darkness. George R. R. Martin, feel free to use this as inspo as you consider the possibility of maaaybe writing Winds of Winter.) Sammy (in his second incarnation) went on to die a death so uneventful I can’t remember it. Charlie lived an absurdly long life for a hamster, though in his later years he developed many large, visible tumors. At first the tumors didn’t seem to bother him, but there came a day that he seemed to be in a lot of pain. My 80-something-year-old great-grandfather, a vet (both in the war and the animal sense), was actually on his way over to euthanize the little guy when Charlie peacefully passed away in Coleman’s hands. It was pretty sad, because even though Charlie was a violent rapist where his own species was concerned, he was remarkably cuddly when it came to people.There were more hamsters after that, but they just didn’t make much of an impression after I’d awakened to some of life’s harshest realities with Charlie, Harvey and Sammy. I think the takeaway here is that, yes, a hamster is absolutely a safer bet for Baby’s First Pet than a dog or cat, but there really are infinite ways to scar a child for life.

  {:title=>"Can I Outrun My Student Loan Debt? A Personal History of Running, Part Two", :date=>"2019-07-05", :summary=>"For the six people who’ve been anxiously awaiting it, here’s the second part of the story of how I became a runner.", :body=>"I stretched my summer post-graduation into a revel that lasted through the better part of fall. During my senior year I was working 30-plus hours a week at my internship with a full-time course load, leadership positions in the student media and active sorority membership. I was stressed, and online shopping and drinking were my primary coping mechanisms.But then I graduated. I woke up the first Monday after graduation and the husband-then-known-as-fiancé was already getting ready to go teach.“Guess what I have to do today?” I asked him. “Uhm, go to work?”“Yes!” I was fully manic. “Go to work! That’s all I have to do today!” This intense gratitude for capitalism would be relatively short-lived, but freedom from classes and extracurriculars had me ready to kiss Adam Smith’s ass. I had two partners in crime that summer. (They will not be named but will 1000% know who they are.) Some kinda summer magic melded the separate, fledgling friendships the three of us had with each other into full-on squad status. We probably went out together once a week. On top of that, I was filling my schedule with as many “dinner and drinks” dates with other friends as I could. And my Millennial job had an onsite keg that coworkers and I would drink from until after dark on those nice summer nights. I wasn’t Mötley Crüe or anything, but I was still drinking more nights than not. There were many times I had to get a ride or Lyft home—not a problem. There were also a few outings that ended with me passed out on a friend’s couch—not ideal. There were even a couple instances I threw up in places I would have preferred not to—not a good look. There is a particular type of shame and anxiety that comes with throwing up in public and waking up in last night’s clothes on a not-your-couch the next morning. It’s not a unique experience, and it’s definitely not the worst thing a person can do, but after two instances of this happening to me in as many months, it was time to pump the brakes. Plus, my student loan grace period was ending, so I had a pressing need to replace my “dinner and drinks” hobby with something more affordable (and less likely to make me gain weight).I didn’t know what else to do, so I ran. Slowly, not far, with a lot of walking in mixed in. I signed up for a “4ish”-mile race in November with my two aforementioned pals. (It’s called the Beer & Bagel run, so it was pretty on-brand for us.) One of the two was a fairly consistent runner who’d completed a couple half marathons, and the other would run her first half a week before the race. I was desperate to not be dead weight in the group, so I started taking my running much more seriously. The familiar, pre-race anxiety made me fear impairing my performance by drinking, so I stayed in the Saturday night before the run. But my friends are normal people who don’t actually care about being in peak physical condition for a fun run at a golf course none of us were coming close to winning anyway, so their night out stretched into the early hours of the morning. When we met to head to the run, one was horribly hungover and one was still a little drunk. Given that, it’s in no way impressive that I was the one setting the (still incredibly slow) pace. But what was surprising to me was that I could actually run the entire 4ish miles. I had no memory of ever going that far without stopping to walk. That race changed everything for me. Those four measly miles unlocked a world of unexplored possibilities. If I could run four miles without stopping, could I run five? Six? Could I run a half marathon? (Later: Could I run a full marathon?) Soon enough, I was finding out—and the answer was yes. My first ever half marathon, completed in 2:13. I’m smiling because I’m about to run what’s still my half marathon PR—1:48.First-ever full marathon. I ran it in 4:17.I spent my 26th birthday running in a 76-mile relay race and it was basically the best day ever. After a few years off, I got back to the race that started it all. (Don’t let the sun squinting fool you, it was a bitterly cold November day.) Crazy is as crazy does. Set a new marathon PR of 4:00. This is only mile 2 of 10 so I haven’t started making gross faces yet. My fourth consecutive year running in the Lincoln Marathon! Not quite a PR with a time of 1:49, but so close I could taste it. 2020 goal: Take better race pics. As I trained, I watched my average pace drop from a 12-minute mile to an 8:30-minute mile. What once seemed like impossibly long distances became my average, weekday run. Change causes change. I cut back on drinking because running hungover is for only the truest masochists. I started structuring my meals around foods that won’t give me the runs during long runs. (No reflection on running is complete without a poop joke!) I initially used music to help me zone out, but after three years of consistent running, I started going without more often than not. These days I usually just plod along to nothing but the sound of my breath and footfalls. I haven’t always been a runner, but maybe I was fated to be one. A set of existing conditions and a 23-years-long series of events (see: determinism) all brought me to this unexpected identity.

  {:title=>"This Earth Day, Do What You Can to Help Our Planet Not Die", :date=>"2019-04-09", :summary=>"Some tips for individuals doing the most to help Mother Natch.", :body=>"97%+ of scientists agree that climate change is 1) real AF and 2) caused by humans. Despite the overwhelming improbability of that many people coming to a consensus on anything and occurrences of devastating natural disasters like land hurricanes, some people still insist that climate change isn’t real.It’s understandable that oil tycoons want to discredit climate change. After all, human greed knows no bounds, and I suppose if we’ve learned nothing else in the past few years, it’s how many people are susceptible to ridiculous lies from billionaires. I can’t think of anything more serious than the threat our planet is facing. Yes, it’s depressing that we have to be nostalgic for the days we all agreed that Nazis are bad, but everybody needs clean air, drinkable water and land they can live off of. Are climate change deniers really willing to gamble the future of the planet based on what non-scientists, who have clear motive to lie, are telling them? Apparently so. After all, we live in a time of flat-earthers and anti-vaxxers; apparently desperately clinging to objectively wrong and harmful beliefs is en vogue.Caring about climate change seems to be a young person’s issue—probably because we’re going to be stuck trying to make a life on this dying-ass planet the Baby Boomers* left us. (Like ruining the economy wasn’t enough.) Seeing these kiddos take action against climate change does give me hope, because let’s get real: Making major policy moves are the only hope we have of getting a handle on this issue. And while a Green New Deal may have some have some economic ramifications, which would you prefer—not having as much cash to burn or not having a planet to live on? I know which one I pick. But until we get the Climate Change Denier-in-Chief and his cronies out of office, we might be stuck doing what little we as individuals can do. Is it enough to make a difference? Maybe not, but we owe it to Mother Natch to try. Here are my best tips.1: Support green policies and politicians.Duh, see above. A bit of good news: Saving our planet looks like it might be turning into a nonpartisan issue! Don’t expect to see Republicans backing the Green New Deal anytime soon, but acceptance is the first step in recovery.2: Don’t litter.I mean. Come on. 3: Get yourself some reusable bags. While they may have given us the incredibly moving Katy Perry lyric Do you ever feel like a plastic bag / Drifting through the wind / Wanting to start again, plastic bags suck. Get some reusable ones and you can even cash in on some lil’ baby discounts at certain stores. Ideally you are not a trash human like me who forgets to bring the reusable bags 50% of the time, but even if you did leave your bags at home, you can go with paper if that’s an option and feel marginally better about yourself. 4: Stop drinking bottled water.Bottled water is just so, so wasteful. Also, it’s stupidly expensive on a personal level! . Buy a reusable water bottle and take it with you everywhere. (My Klean Kanteen is dented to hell and back, but it keeps my water icy cold.) You may also get the added benefit of drinking more water, which is dope. 5: Lose the straw.Have you heard about the sea turtles? I’m sure you’ve heard about the sea turtles. If you can’t bear to drink your ice latte from the cup itself, invest in some reusable straws. 6: Buy local food when you can. Look, I get it—the act of purchasing groceries in and of itself is difficult enough. Getting all locally sourced food is just not always going to be an option, but it has serious environmental benefits and it helps support your local economy. Go to farmer’s markets and eat at restaurants with locally sourced food, check out local CSAs or start your own garden. 7: Up your recycling game. The majority of us probably recycle at least sometimes—like the average five Amazon boxes most of us receive a week. (Or is that just my house?) Those are pretty easy to break down and toss in the bin. The peanut butter jar, however, is more troublesome, because you have to wash that shit out, and peanut butter is one of the top five worst things to clean out of anything. But take one for Team Earth next time and do it anyway. 8: Cut down on one-use products. Advance to the next level of eco-friendliness by reusing enough that you don’t need to recycle. This is admittedly very hard for me, because lazy. I have not yet found the strength within me to forego paper towels entirely in favor of dish cloths. Someday! I did manage to ditch my makeup removing cotton pads because I learned that these washable bamboo pads that meant to soak up leaking tit milk (or something—breastfeeding freaks me out so I’m fuzzy on the details) work just as well. 9: Try Meatless Mondays.Meat and dairy industries are huge contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. Just going meatless once a week helps. Part of the reason I went vegan—in addition to being really :( about how the industrial agriculture industry treats animals—was doing Mother Natch a solid. 10: Ditch fast fashion.Who among us doesn’t love clothes shopping at Target? It is truly one of the best experiences life has to offer, but unfortunately, those cute, cheap clothes can come at a price—namely, unsustainable production practices and exploited workers. Target is improving, but brands like H&M aren’t doing so hot. In 2018, I quit ‘em cold turkey. Now my clothes come from retailers like Everlane and Teeki or thrift stores. Like my bottled water embargo, this has saved me a lot of money, because overall I’m buying far fewer clothing items. I’m not living the greenest possible life. I already told you about the paper towels; plus, living in the Midwest, I take no public transit, and I usually travel by plane a couple times a year. There’s a lot of room for improvement—and most of that is within industry, not individuals. But until we get some MFing regulation up in here (or until the planet gasps its dying breaths, whichever comes first), let’s keep doing our best. What are you doing to have Mother Natch’s back?

I’ve been running consistently for 1,200+ days, so I think it’s safe to say the habit’s stuck. “Runner” has become a core part of my identity, for myself and for others. There are people in my life now who never knew me as not a runner. They want to know: “Have you always been a runner?”It’s a long story, and it’s not even a particularly interesting one—I mean, no one died or narrowly avoided a stabbing, and it’s not like I ended up being an Olympian or some shit—but who’s gonna tell it if not me?Like most kids, I ran when I was playing and I ran on command during gym class. Running at recess was something I looked forward to, but doing it in P.E. was torture. (Remember running the mile for the Presidential Fitness Test?)Then came junior high. I grew up in a small town where unless you were a nerd or a delinquent, you went out for a sport. To be clear, I was totally a nerd, but I somehow had decent social standing that, at 13, I was desperate to maintain. So I went out for cross country, a choice made based my lack of hand-eye coordination and fear of being hit in the head with a wayward sports ball. I don’t have a lot of memories of cross country—either because it was so long ago or because I repressed them, who’s to say—but recollections include:Practicing with the high schoolers and being both intimidated by the boys and disgusted by all their spitting. I do remember liking and admiring most of the girls, though. (#feminism)Feeling myself slowly starve to death that first month because the beginning of season coincided with getting braces. My mouth hurt so terribly all I managed to eat was applesauce, and I was doing an unprecedented amount of exercise. (More than 10 years later,  I would come to know this type of ceaseless hunger again while marathon training, though luckily orthodontia was no longer a factor.)Taking turns finishing dead last at every meet with the only other junior high girl from my school. We were besties, but it’s sort of a chicken-and-egg thing—I can’t remember if we were friends who went out for the team together, or if we became friends because what choice did we have?The cross country season ended and I had a short reprieve until track and field season rolled around. Other than trap (as in, trap shooting for anyone lucky enough to not know what that is), I think track was the only spring sport offered—and everyone went out.Being on the cross county team was similar to riding the subway. For me, a Midwesterner, public transit is very inconvenient and kind of nerve-racking, but it’s also fascinating and I know I’m getting a good life experience when I suck it up and do it instead of shelling out for a Lyft. Being on the track team, though, was similar to seeing what I owed in student loans during my college exit counseling: Just really fucking depressing and anxiety-inducing all around.The coaches made everyone on the team do at least one track event and one field event. It was obvious I wasn’t going to be winning any races at all, but I super wasn’t going to be winning any speed races, so I ran the 800 meter or the mile. For my field event, I dabbled in long jump. I was terrible. They had me move on to pole vaulting, citing my shortness as an advantage. I was terrible, but there were significantly less pole vaulters so I was stuck doing it. For us mediocre and piss-poor tracksters, meets were more social events than anything. And it was fun, sitting around in the usually-nice weather in our sweats, snacking on whatever junk food we’d packed. But I had no fun until I’d finished “competing.” Until my events were done, I was too busy taking anxiety shits to mingle with the team. A deep dark secret: One meet, I was so frantic to get out of competing that I repeatedly hit my ankle against the toilet in an attempt to sprain, fracture or break it. It probably goes without saying, but I was unsuccessful in Operation Self-Harm to Avoid Athletics. At last junior high ended, and I dropped cross country and track like the big old deuces they kept rousing in my bowels to join theater and the speech team (activities that also gave me nervy poos, but were at least gratifying enough to make it worth it). Over the next four years, I only ran short distances, interspersed with lots of walking, on my mom’s treadmill in the privacy of the basement. I went to college. I didn’t do anything that could be remotely construed as exercise; my schedule was full with class, non-sport activities and drinking. Enough drinking (and subsequent fast food eating) that I gained some not-insignificant weight. During summers, I moved back home and filled some of that drinking time with treadmill time. I’d shed some of the weight and then return for fall semester ready to begin the entire process again.Then I graduated and I didn’t move home. I transitioned immediately into Adult™ life, complete with full-time, career-track employment and cohabitation with my fiancé. I was ready to celebrate, and running was the absolute last way I was going to do it.

Imperative.", :body=>"I’m four days into my Naked and Afraid binge and convinced it’s imperative I learn how to start a fire with a bow drill. Imperative.Seth emerges from his office, where he’s been playing video games for hours, to find me in the recliner, where I’ve been watching Naked and Afraid for hours. (Marriage is exciting!)“The guy on this episode is from Nebraska! Grand Island!” I blurt, possibly foaming at the mouth. “Cool,” he says as he ascends the stairs. “Could you grab me some water while you’re up there?” I shout.This scenario repeats itself over the course of the next few days:Seth leaves his office for food or water.“These two are totally gonna fuck,” I tell him with relish.He glances at the TV. “No they’re not.” And heads upstairs.“Yes they are!” I insist to his retreating back.He re-surfaces an episode or two later. I still have not moved.“This chick’s all by herself but she just caught a tiny pig! Don’t worry, she let it go.” “Wow,” he says, not sounding particularly impressed.(Later, I will convince him to watch some of my favorite episodes with me. They’re just that good.)***I’ve been fan of Naked and Afraid since I was in college, when I caught some of the first season while back at my parents’ house during a break. Alas, as I moved into my adult life as a cable-less Millennial, I didn’t keep up with the show (which airs on the Discovery Channel). Over the 2018 holiday season, in my aspiration to do as little as possible outside my daily runs, I was looking for some plotless entertainment, and then, what I can only guess was divine inspiration led me to wonder: Is Naked and Afraid on Hulu?And over the next week, I watched a bunch of naked people eat approximately 35 snakes over the course of six-ish seasons. ***If you are unfamiliar with Naked and Afraid, here’s what you need to know:Each episode features one man and one woman, who the show refers to as “survivalists,” as they attempt to survive in a remote location for 21 days. It is not entirely clear a) where Discovery finds these people or b) what qualifies someone as a survivalist, but it seems like the majority of the contestants are either wilderness instructors, ex-military or stay-at-home moms or dads. The contestants have no clothes and you spend a lot of time wondering how many bugs the women find in their labia. (Most of the remote locations are to mosquitos and sand flies what fraternity houses are to date rape.) The contestants have no water other than what the land provides. If you watch the show chronologically, as I have, you will notice how few contestants get dysentery from drinking bad water in later seasons compared to the first. The contestants have no food, and, as I mentioned, there is a LOT of snake eating, and also a lot of bug eating. Because it’s reality TV, the most enjoyable part of the show is, of course, the interactions between the contestants themselves.Also, because it’s reality TV, what you see is not necessarily what you get. Fortunately for me, knowing this in no way ruins the magic of the show. ***Moments on the show tend to repeat themselves. I get it—after all, how many different ways can this premise possibly play out? Some of my favorite tropes include:One of the contestants boasts about their primitive fire-making abilities. Then they proceed to unsuccessfully make a fire for at least a week into their 21 days, if ever. (It’s apparently a little easier to start a fire in California than it is in the Amazon rain forest.)The male contestant is ex-military or ex-police and a low-key misogynist who comes into the challenge screaming about how he will “make nature [his] bitch!” The female contestant is a hippie who knows better than to try to control Mother Nature. There is Tension.One partner wants to cuddle at night for body heat. The other partner is Not Into It (if it’s the woman who doesn’t want to cuddle, it’s because she feels weird cuddling with a “strange man” and if it’s the man, it’s “out of respect for his wife,” as if the hot 20-something he’s paired with for the challenge actually wants to get carnal with some middle-aged dude with a gut and receding hairline) and sometimes a fight ensues. The male contestant boasts about his hunting skills, but actually cannot kill anything without some sort of rifle. His partner ends up getting their food, and he explicitly says he’s upset because not providing the food for the team makes him feel like less of a man. Other than reading any news story ever about Trump, where else can you get this kind of stunning insight into the fragility of the male ego?!One of the contestants may not have “primitive survival” experience, but is an “endurance athlete,” meaning they run marathons or something similar. That apparently gives them a chance in hell at surviving in the wilderness for 21 days without food or water, even though aid stations, where people literally thrust food and water at you, are a staple of endurance events like marathons and ultramarathons. One of the contestants taps out before the 21 days are up, leaving the other alone. When this happens early on in the challenge,  the remaining contestant often starts to totally lose their shit without significant human contact. This scenario generally plays out in a Wilson-esque fashion, but sometimes it gets a little more real—like when one guy sobs into the camera, as, alone, he processes the grief of his three-year-old daughter dying a couple years prior. That’s some heavy shit, and also a producer’s wet dream. ***This binge has spurred a lot of self-reflection for me. Why do I like Naked and Afraid so much? Is it the juxtaposition of seeing the triumph of the human spirit against the elements in one episode, then watching people quit because of bugs in the next? Is it the gratification of seeing lots of over-confident bros get their asses handed to them by neature? The interesting thing about Naked and Afraid (besides the nudity and snake eating) is the range of highs and lows the contestants—and, by extension, the viewer—experience. Some episodes portray the experience as an exercise in misery. Others make the whole 21-day survival challenge look totally doable, even fun. Even within an episode, you see the hopelessness brought on by dehydration and starvation contrasted with the elation of finding a resource that makes it possible to survive another day.Even in civilization, life can be that way—things can go from fine to shit to awesome in the span of a single day. Naked and Afraid shows us, albeit in an extreme way, the tumultuousness inherent in being human. ", :image_url=>""},
  {:title=>"Don't Stop Me Now", :date=>"2019-01-01", :summary=>"This holiday season, I went streaking. Not in the “no clothes on a summer camp dare” way, but the “running every day” way.", :body=>"This holiday season, I went streaking. Not in the “no clothes on a summer camp dare” way, but the “running every day” way. Runner’s World hosts a yearly run streak from Thanksgiving to New Year’s Day to encourage people to keep running over the holidays. I usually run five days a week if I’m training for a race, and four if I’m not. But my pre- and post-long run rest days are usually sacred, so I’ve never participated. Until this year. Why?Goals. At the beginning of 2018, I set a goal to run 1,500 miles over the course of the year—an increase on the 1,225 miles I ran in 2017. With a couple sub-100-mile months in February, May and July, I knew I needed to step it up in the final months of 2018. Training timing. I signed up for the February 2019 Austin Marathon in July and have been training since September. Instead of falling on my “offseason” between fall and spring half marathons, this year the run streak happened during my ramp-up to peak mileage in January. Matt Fitzgerald told me to. One of the books I read this year was The New Rules of Marathon and Half-Marathon Nutrition: A Cutting-Edge Plan to Fuel Your Body Beyond \"the Wall\" by Matt Fitzgerald. I bought it because the back cover said it’d help me “avoid common pitfalls such as GI discomfort during running.” While he shared no secrets that helped me stop shitting in the woods every long run, Fitzgerald does recommend running—slowly—every day during training for runners that can do so without injury. Why not? I’d never run more than five days in a row before. I wanted to see what would happen if I did. So I did it. I ran every day for 41 days—runs ranging from 1.3 to 22 miles for an average of 6 miles a day. Most were in the cold, some were in the snow and one was even in the pouring rain. My average pace was between 8:45 and 9:15 minutes per mile—compared to an average pace of 8:30–8:45 during runs prior to the streak.Here’s what happened. Goals? Crushed ‘em. I closed out 2018 with 1,532 miles. It’s nothin’ on Pete Kostelnick’s 10,000+ miles, but as a mere mortal, I’ll take it. I was tired. Staying up past 10 p.m. became a Herculean feat. On weekdays, I was often asleep at 9:30 and up around 5:30. On weekends, I went to bed around the same time, but slept in an extra hour or two. Over the holidays, I still slept eight to 10 hours a night and spent most of my non-running waking hours on the recliner. I was hungry. Carbs, carbs, carbs, just like Matt Fitzgerald told me. I started thinking of myself as The Very Hungry Caterpillar—or rather, the Very Hungry Hannah, devouring endless servings of pasta, rice, bananas, applesauce, tofu, toast, beans, Brussels sprouts and peanut butter pancakes, supplemented with holiday dips and pastries. Relentless hunger comes with the marathon training territory, even when you’re not running every day. But I wasn’t injured. Whether it was my dynamic pre-run stretch and static post-run routine, the nonstop eating or the heavy sleeping, I made it through 41 days of running without any injury and with minimal soreness. And I didn’t get sick of it. More than getting physically injured, I feared mental burnout. But it never came. Of course there were days that I didn’t feel like running, but they were no more frequent than when I was running four or five days a week. I always felt better after getting my run in—proving, at least in some cases, there’s no such thing as too much of a good thing. Let’s see if I can keep the streak going.

While all the books I read this year were at least “okay” and most of them were “pretty good,” my top five come with the entirely figurative Hannah Book Club seal. The “you gotta read ‘ems” are: Educated: A Memoir, Tara WestoverI’m far from the first to discover this book, as it’s been appearing on nearly every best-of-2018 list out there, but Educated is both an incredibly powerful tale about escaping from unfortunate circumstances, what a person owes their family, and the power of an education—as well as an incredibly entertaining read. Raised in a hyper-religious, doomsday-prepper family, Westover never went to school and didn’t even have a birth certificate—until she eventually became inspired by an older brother to take the ACT and attend Brigham Young University. It was only there that she realized how incomplete her education had been, illustrated perfectly in an almost unbelievable incident where she asks a college professor what the Holocaust is. Put this book on your list. Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen, Christopher MacDougallBorn to Run was published in 2009, but in case you, like me, lived nine years without reading this, I feel compelled to tell you it’s snagged a place as one of my favorite books of all time. (Seriously—I haven’t shut up about Born to Run since I finished it in July.) If you’re an avid runner, it’s a must-read. If you’re a casual or on-and-off-again runner, this book will still inspire. And even if you truly hate running, you’ll still be taken in by MacDougall’s superb storytelling. Go read it, go run, then read this bummer of an epilogue. My Year of Rest and Relaxation, Ottessa MoshfeghThis was another find via a quick Google of “best books of 2018.” While I love dark humor, I wasn't entirely sure that the I’d enjoy this book based on the premise: A 20-something art gallery worker living in New York in 2000 enlists a quack psychiatrist to help her sleep her life away through a wicked cocktail of prescription drugs. But for a novel that revolves around its protagonist being passed out, this was a remarkably quick read, and I couldn’t put it down. Something about our anti-heroine’s quest to completely shut out the outside world resonated with me; after all, who among us hasn’t occasionally longed for a year of total oblivion? Between reading her profound depiction of ennui and a fascinating profile about the author herself, I’m looking forward to seeing what Moshfegh comes out with next. The Opposite of Hate: A Field Guide to Repairing Our Humanity, Sally KohnIt can feel pretentious to call books important, but if any book deserves the adjective, it’s The Opposite of Hate. Political commentator Sally Kohn sets out to examine the root causes of hate between in-group and out-groups from her Twitter trolls and Trump voters to white supremacists and participants in the Rwandan genocide. (Side note: Speaking of incomplete educations, how the hell did I know next to nothing about the Rwandan genocide before this book?) It can be difficult to read at times. Kohn’s conversations with her Twitter trolls exposes the baffling ways people will behave badly online that they wouldn’t in real life, and her interviews with Rwandans who suddenly and viciously turned on their neighbors are staggering. But she weaves bits of humor throughout the book, and ultimately offers hopeful ways for us to move forward as a species—something we desperately, desperately need.   Priestdaddy: A Memoir, Patricia LockwoodLockwood’s family life sounds like fiction, not memoir. When she and her husband were broke, they moved back in with her parents—in her father’s rectory. Her father is one of the few married Catholic priests, and he has a host of other quirks besides. Lockwood recounts them with equal parts fondness and exasperation and enough wit to make me LOL. Almost every book list named this a best book of 2017, and if you missed out on it last year, consider picking it up for 2019. Finally, a pro tip: Check out your local library, where you can get most of these to read fo’ free. Read any of these?

  {:title=>"Are You Embarrassing Yourself? (You Should Be)", :date=>"2018-08-18", :summary=>"I can be pretty embarrassing. I have a sense of humor that has been described as “bizarre and borderline off-putting” and I love wearing socks and ‘Stocks.", :body=>"I can be pretty embarrassing. I have a sense of humor that has been described as “bizarre and borderline off-putting” and I love wearing socks and ‘Stocks.Snapchat received July 2018. This is our backyard. Embarrassing. Sometimes I get excited about something and start talking about it way too loudly in public. Sometimes I make weird faces without realizing that I’m doing it. I've dressed up as Winky the house elf from Harry Potter (yes, there are pictures; no, you cannot see them), and once I took my cat outdoors on a leash while I was wearing Family Guy boxers, an activity made even more embarrassing due to my cat clearly hating every minute of it. Life hack: Don’t try to walk your cat.We all do things that make us a little embarrassing. You probably know someone who legitimately likes Twilight, laughs too loudly and too often in the movie theater, takes bathroom mirror selfies, plays World of Warcraft, calls their significant other “baby,” or is a mouth breather.Yes, these things are all embarrassing. However, they are the harmless kind of embarrassing. The kind of embarrassing that makes us human, and, in small doses, even a little endearing. These are examples of the kind of embarrassing we should embrace.IMPORTANT CAVEAT:Unfortunately, not all things that are embarrassing are harmless. We all have been embarrassing in a manner that can’t be written off as quirky, and most of us regret that and don’t care to be reminded of it, so I won’t get specific. But if you’re wondering if your embarrassing-ness is Not Okay, here’s a helpful checklist:Once something embarrassing stops being harmless, it becomes shameful. Life hack: Try to avoid doing things that are shameful.Assuming that your embarrassing-ness is of the harmless variety, make peace with it. Maybe you love Nickelback, can speak Klingon, quote memes in your everyday conversation, or frequently wear Crocs. Say what you will about the concept of liking something ironically: It has allowed us to accept hobbies, interests and ideas that are outside the norm. What used to be aggressively dorky is now uniquely cool.More importantly, being unafraid to occasionally let others know how embarrassing you are is good for both others and yourself. We all know people who are so utterly unembarrassing that they are completely intimidating to interact with. We generally avoid these people, because their lack of embarrassing-ness just makes us feel more embarrassing than we actually are. When you are your true, embarrassing self, you put others at ease. Life hack: Putting others at ease makes them want to be around you more.Of course, not everyone will find the embarrassing things you do as fascinating and charismatic as you’d hope. That’s fine. The bigger benefit here is that you are more at ease with yourself when you embrace your embarrassing-ness. When you don’t tell anyone about the three pizzas you ate that time you were really hangry because you’re afraid they’ll judge you, it becomes a deep, dark secret. When you admit it, despite your embarrassment, it becomes a strange but funny thing you did. (And, in the right peoples’ eyes, you become a hero.)So go forth and embarrass the hell out of yourself.Post originally appeared on Firespring's blog on August 7, 2015.

  {:title=>"Life Is Not a TV Show (But Sometimes It Seems Like It)", :date=>"2018-08-01", :summary=>"Sometimes I pretend my life is a TV show.Sometimes I realize it’s totally not.But sometimes it kinda feels like it is.", :body=>"In college, one of my roommates had some serious Truman syndrome, and it spread. Soon, we were all referencing the events of the past couple days as if they'd played out on the small screen. \"This is an episode,\" someone would say. We all lived in a quad (a black mold-infested suite of four rooms, a bathroom and a common room)—ours was Quad 5. It was from there we drew the title of our series—simply Five. We came up with A plots, B plots, and C plots. In hindsight, basically all of them had to do with drinking. Like when three of us hosted a game of Edward Winehands and I puked so many places in the bathroom and spent so long cleaning it up that I forgot it was actually mine, that was a part of an episode. Or when one roommate and another friend got caught by campus security naked in the library at midnight, that was an episode too. Or when two of us got so drunk at the bar that we hopped into a strangers car and ordered they drive us back to the quads, that was definitely an episode (and no, it didn't up being an episode of Special Victims Unit). ***Life, however, is not a TV show.A sharp reminder of this came when Seth and I were looking for our first house. I can talk about this now, because we did find The One™, but only after some serious heartbreak.The market in Lincoln was (and still is) crazy. Houses commonly sold within days of being listed. Everything move-in ready was going for above asking. We even heard about one couple who bought a house sight unseen.In our first meeting with a realtor, she made a point to tell us that we might be looking for awhile, given the state of the market and the fact that we had an average budget. She said to be prepared to move quickly and still be disappointed. We moved quickly, and we were still disappointed.The house that broke our hearts: Tall, skinny, four bedroom, two bath house not far from our current neck of the woods and conveniently located by our one of our favorite restaurants, a run-down but amazing Ethiopian place. No yard or garage, but a walk-in closet in the master, a pantry, laundry on the first floor and completely ready for someone (us! Pick us! Let it be us!) to move in.The timeline: We'd offered well above the asking price, so I'd assumed we had a good shot. But the accepted offer was also for well over asking...in cash, waived home inspection. There was no way we could compete with that offer—I mean, even if I were to be ransomed, I don't think my parents have that kind of cash on hand—but I was no less devastated. I was at dinner with friends and mostly held it together until my drive home. That's when the crushing depression hit, and I spent the next day in a funk so deep I think my coworkers could actually smell it on me. I kept thinking about GIlmore Girls, the episode where Luke is trying to buy the Twickham House for him and Lorelai and their future family. He's all set to get it, until town weirdo Kirk comes in ready to pay for it all in the cash he's amassed working odd jobs throughout town over his lifetime. Because it's a TV show, the town elders (which are a thing because, TV show) somehow end up deciding who should get the house—and it's Luke, because they deem him more deserving, having waited years for Lorelai. We were Luke. The other, cash-rich, no-inspection-needing buyer was Kirk. But this is not a TV show, and there was no panel of town elders to anoint us as worthier of the property. ***Sometimes, though, life is kind of like a TV show. It was our wedding day. I was feeling good. Sure, there were some butterflies prior to walking down to the ceremony, but there had been no major freak outs.No major freak outs...yet.I arrived at the alter. The judge began speaking. All was going well.Our friend read the poem we'd selected. I almost started crying, because it's a really nice poem. As he neared the end of the poem, though, my lovey-dovey sappy feelings were replaced by shit-fuck-shit panic—because I knew what was coming next in our ceremony, and I knew we were missing some key items.To back it up: Having a nonreligious wedding ceremony is awesome for several reasons. One, it's short, two, people can drink during it and three, no downer Bible verses. However, a nonreligious ceremony can be challenging, because when you take out all the god...what do you do? We'd decided on a (really nice, as I mentioned) poetry reading and a song during the ceremony played by some talented musician friends. To avoid the awkwardness of standing there, staring at each other for the song's duration, we decided we'd write letters to each other with the intent of reading them on our one-year anniversary.The morning of the wedding, I brought pens and paper and envelopes for that specific purpose to our venue, intending to ask our ushers to bring them down to our ceremony area as the time drew closer.(Can you see where this is going? I bet you can see where this is going.)I forgot to ask the ushers to bring down the letter supplies. I forgot to even tell anyone about the existence of the letter supplies.  As the poem finished, I turned to the judge and my maid of honor in a panic. \"I left the letter stuff up in the barn,\" I hissed. \"Okay, do you want me to go get it?\" my maid of honor whispered back.I had a split second to make a decision. The barn was really just up the stairs from the ceremony, but proximity wasn't the issue. My bridesmaids and I had been lounging there all day, eating, drinking, getting ready and it was absolutely packed with everyone's crap. The letter supplies were on a bench in a plastic bag. They were probably one of 29 different things sitting on a bench in a plastic bag. My maid of honor had no idea which one was the right one.It wasn't worth it. The whole point of writing the letters during the song was to avoid a period of awkward inactivity during the song. Sending someone to fetch the stuff would only spur a period of awkward inactivity, only without the song. \"Never mind. Let's just nix it.\"Seth nodded, affirming my decision. The judge began to move on:\"Well, the bride and groom were going to write letters to each other but—\" here we looked at the guests guiltily. I was forcing a manic smile, trying to play it off as a cute \"oopsie.\"\"Oh, wait, you know what?\" Our judge took one of the sheets she'd finished reading from and tore it in half. She had a pen in her portfolio.\"Does anyone have another pen?\" Without missing a beat, a teacher at Seth's school whipped out a pen and tossed it to him. Seth knew exactly where to look and caught it. And then the musicians began to play, and we wrote our letters.Later, people asked if we'd planned it like that.As seen on TV. ", :image_url=>"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/566266fce4b04e4daff1eae1/1533167280849-BR2MW7ZD401FQSTJFTO7/22308969_1715246645165678_2299383476990906334_n.jpg?format=500w"},
  {:title=>"What (Lazy) Vegans Eat: Why Being Vegan Is Easier Than You Think", :date=>"2018-06-22", :summary=>"Today I'm going to debunk the common misconceptions that eating vegan is:Expensive. We are Broke-Ass Millennials™ and we are happy to report that our grocery bill is comparable to our bill pre-veganism. (And we actually eat out significantly less, resulting in savings!)Difficult. I am both inept in the kitchen and incredibly lazy and therefore would have reverted back to turkey 'n' sammiches in a week if I lacked for easy, animal-free ways to feed myself. Joyless. Life would not be worth living if I was eating only spinach or some shit all day. Luckily, I still look forward to most of my meals, because they are tasty.", :body=>"Today I'm going to debunk the common misconceptions that eating vegan is:Here are the reasonably-priced, easy-enough, delicious vegan things we shove in our mouth holes.But first, a few disclaimers...These meals adequately fuel both my husband and myself. I run about 20–30 miles a week and maintain an ashtanga yoga practice; my husband lifts several days a week and also has a yoga practice (with the occasional short run mixed in). That said, vegan does not automatically equate to healthy. These meals are relatively healthy when compared to the average American diet, but they are not strictly whole foods plant based and may not fit your specific dietary needs.Finally, I've noted the grocery stores where I've found many of these ingredients, but it's by no means an exhaustive list.  Now let's get to the good stuff. PizzaDo I miss pizza? Hell no I don't miss pizza, because I eat it at about once a week. Homemade pizza is one of our go-tos. Here's how we make ours:Throw on some veggies (I like spinach and diced red peppers) and cook at 425–450 degrees for about 12 minutes. Top with NOOCH! Boom. Burgers & FriesAnother easy staple that we make at least once a week. For the burger patties, our faves are:Most store-bought fries will be vegan, though we're partial to Hy-Vee's sweet potato fries. We use Orowheat whole wheat buns and sometimes throw some Chao cheese (found at Whole Foods) on that bad boy. NOTE: All of Field Roast's vegan meats and cheeses are delicious.BrinnerTofu scramble, featuring black beans and whatever veggies we have on hand—usually red peppers, mushrooms and/or spinach—has become a breakfast or, just as often, a breakfast for dinner staple. Nooch, turmeric, onion, garlic powder and buttery spread make this shit even more flavorful than your standard scrambled eggs. And it's easy as hell to make. Vegan waffles and/or pancakes are also usually on the docket. We're still searching for the perfect recipe, but this is the one I used in the picture above, and it was pretty tasty. We were tragically out of maple syrup, so I subbed some agave nectar.Field Roast makes a dope breakfast sausage, but I've only found it at Whole Foods, so it's more of a treat than an everyday staple. NoodsBeing vegan means never having to feel guilty for consuming all the hot, steamy noods you can. (IMO.) Some of our favorite recipes come from Isa Chandra Moskowitz and Thug Kitchen. These cookbooks do have non-pasta dishes, but...pasta.DessertThis cake. THIS. MOTHER. FUCKING. CAKE. It is so, so good. This is the frosting recipe we have now used twice in the past week, and it's a winner if you like your frosting the same way I like my men (rich and thiiick). The cake recipe comes from Chocolate Covered Katie. It is absolutely delicious. I've made several of Katie's \"healthy\" vegan desserts, and while they all have been okay or good, this one deserves a damn Nobel Peace Prize, or the cooking equivalent. I also have consumed what is a frankly staggering amount of vegan ice cream. (Remember how I said this isn't a whole foods plant based diet? Yeah.) Here are my faves:Eating OutEating out is not as easy as it used to be, but it's also not impossible. Most Asian and Mexican places can offer you vegan-friendly options besides a sad ass salad with nothing on. (Nothing infuriates me more than getting stuck eating a sad ass salad because a restaurant's veggie burger is made with egg or some bullshit.)Chain restaurants are often shockingly vegan friendly. Google is your friend when it comes to checking on particular eateries, but my top picks for easy vegan eating are:There you have it. If you've ever considered going vegan—whether it's for environmental or ethical reasons or because you saw a scary Netflix documentary about meat—but have felt like it's an impossible lifestyle change, hopefully it now looks a little less daunting. Comment if you want to talk more about food, particularly ice cream. And, any fellow vegans reading, please comment with your favorite easy vegan eats!", :image_url=>"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/566266fce4b04e4daff1eae1/1529460226246-AYXGWFEDCQFN1TY4QEN6/IMG_0578.JPG?format=500w"},

I'm half certain that this is how we die, but in less than 20 (heart-pounding, life-affirming) minutes, we've arrived.Suddenly feeling entirely too badass, I smile as we finally find the perfect selfie angle, still perched on the back of the scooter, with the sign of our destination in the background: Ninja Ink.***The idea was born in July of 2015 after, as with most great but slightly irresponsible ideas, heavy beer drinking.In a few weeks, one of my best friends from college would leave the country for a year, bound for Taiwan on a Fulbright scholarship. It was our last hurrah, and several hours of drinking in, we'd arrived at the \"oh my God I'm gonna miss you so much ugh I love you\" stage of the night.I don't remember who said it first: WE SHOULD GET TATTOOS. \"Are you serious?\"\"Yeah I'm fuckin' serious! We should do it!\"\"WE SHOULD DO IT!\"\"What should we get?\"I do remember that it was my drunk-ass idea: \"We should get plus signs,\" I slurred. \"Because it means you, plus me. And,\" I added, pragmatism bubbling to the surface, \"if we ever stop being friends, it's like, kinda vague.\"My logic was sound enough to us, but we needed a gut check before following through on our decision to get something permanently etched into our skin. So in line at the bar bathroom, we detailed our plan to the other drunk bitches waiting to pee.\"Oh my God that's SO COOL,\" they slurred back at us, encouraging and enabling us in only the way drunk-bitches-in-arms can. Validated, we set out into the summer night. For Krista, it would be a second tattoo; for me, a first. But we were thwarted, because, as with most drunken shenanigans, it was after midnight. No parlors were open, not even Bob's Needle Palace.Hungover, we laughed about it the next morning. In the year that followed, the plus sign became a cross between a running joke and a term of endearment between us.***At Ninja Ink, the proprietors of the shop, an Australian husband-wife duo, turn our year-long inside joke into something tangible. Krista's plus sign is tiny and thin on her wrist; mine is about twice the size (an inch circumference), on my inner bicep. It hurts about as much as I expected, which is to say it's neither excruciating nor enjoyable. The pain of a tattoo isn't as stinging as the pain of a bikini wax, but it is much less relenting. After, I can't stop looking at it. So small, but still so stark on my milky white skin. We have ice cream then go back to our hostel, where we clean our pluses and rub on the healing ointment they gave us at the parlor.***My mother does not like tattoos. I did not inform her of my intention to get one beforehand, and it was, in the end, excruciatingly pre-meditated. I know she is annoyed by its presence, but after a single, snide comment to let me know she knows, she goes out of her way to ignore it. In turn, I can't resist making offhand comment about it—how it's peeling now, how I need to go wash it again, how it's itching—gently needling in hope of a reaction, trying to provoke a fight and get it over with, if one must happen, but my mother bears the indignity of my tattoo with the patience of a saint.Unlike my mother, my fiancée knew about my plan to commemorate my trip with some ink, but he too is less than enthused about it. But Seth accepts it, eyes rolling. I think that this tattoo, this small, black flaw, is the probably the least of the prices they pay for loving me.***In my philosophy classes, we talked about the ship of Theseus, a classic philosophical thought experiment.In a nutshell:When the Greek hero Theseus returned from slaying the Minotaur in Crete to Athens, the Athenians saved and preserved the ship that bore him home. Over time, the the wood began to decay. At first, the Athenians removed only a single rotted plank, but eventually the entire ship had been replaced with new wood that Theseus had never laid hand nor set foot on. The question, the paradox: Is it still the same ship? If not, when did it stop being the same ship?***I spend train ride from Geneva to Zurich dozing on Seth's shoulder, listening to Spotify, and cataloging the changes in my life since I last traveled abroad. Perhaps most notable (at least in the eyes of society and the law) is the transition from fiancé to wife. There are other changes too: I've run a marathon. I can do a headstand. I stopped eating meat. But what hasn't changed? My name, and a thousand small, subtle things: I still wake up early. I still leave the house with my hair wet from my shower. I still speaker louder than necessary. I still like IPAs. I am different than the person I was at 16, when I thought bottom-eye eyeliner was a good look and didn't understand white privilege. Am I different than the person I was at 23? Maybe not so drastically, but maybe at least a little. ***Seth and I arrive at Born 1891 after passing it by a couple times. It's hidden from passersby beneath a parking garage, but once we get close enough, the large vinyl \"TATTOO\" on the door assures me we've found the place.He performs his husbandly duty by waiting with me for the artist to arrive, a woman with an Italian accent and movie star beauty. Like with everyone we encounter in Zurich, her English is good enough that we can easily discuss what I want my next tattoo to be. Half an hour later, I can say I have tattoos, multiple. Since this one is on my shoulder, I can only ogle it in the mirror, the stark black lines and dots that form my favorite constellation: Orion, the warrior.We go to dinner, then hop on the bus back to our room. As he peels off the Bandaid-secured cling wrap and gets his first look at the fresh ink, Seth says, \"I don't hate it.\"  ", :image_url=>"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/566266fce4b04e4daff1eae1/1519267241811-7MDCYV6NFTFL3YIBXTRN/unnamed.jpg?format=500w"},

Of course, I've gotten a lot of other questions about my \"alternative lifestyle\"—which I'm happy to answer.Where do you get your protein?Ah, this old, well-meaning chestnut...Plants and grains can give you all the protein you need—which is considerably less than you might be consuming now. My recommended amount is 40 grams, which I usually exceed without trying. Do you feel different?Yes. Things (read: poops) are significantly more regular. I feel like I’m running faster. I'm only bloated, like, three days of the month instead of 20. I have a smug sense of moral superiority, which you all know is something I’ll do just about anything for.Don’t you miss cheese?Not really. And while I can't know this for certain as I quit animal products cold turkey, I suspect the omission of dairy is what's contributed most to my improved digestion. Can you still go out to eat?If I couldn't life wouldn't be worth living. Lots of places offer vegan options with no modifications, and most places have things that decent choices if you make some modifications. One exception is Arby's. Fuck you, Arby's. That said, the husband and I are eating at home now more than ever, which is good for so many reasons—it's almost always healthier, it's definitely cheaper and cooking is empowering (or so I am told). Isn’t it expensive?Vegan does not mean always organic. Meat is pricey, veggies are not. You don’t need to lose weight!Vegan does not always mean healthy. Ben & Jerry's has dairy-free (vegan) pints, and while they are delicious, they're about as nutritionally void as the original stuff. Another thing that's vegan? Oreos. When you start eating vegan, most people assume you do it for “health reasons,” which is rapidly becoming the polite term for weight loss. While everyone I know who's stopped eating animal products has seen health improvements, there are other, hugely compelling reasons to adopt not just a vegan diet, but a vegan lifestyle. So now you're going to get all preachy and try to convince me to be vegan? Just a little. The animals used to make food for us are treated really, really badly. The free-roaming chickens and happy cows you picture in your head are not the norm. There is a ton of information out there if you don't trust me on this, but I'm not going to find it for you because thinking about it is super upsetting to me. I'm guessing it probably is for you too, but, like I did for nearly 25 years, you don't think about it too much because meat tastes good. Animal ethics go beyond our food—animal testing is also super depressing, and, guess what, a shit ton of companies are still doing it. In the past months I've switched to toothpaste, hand soap and deodorant that's cruelty-free. (Good thing my cosmetic and makeup faves happened to be cruelty-free.) Just like how milk and eggs somehow weasel their way into foods they have no business being in, animal testing is so prevalent that it happens for products you wouldn't think warrant it. It's not about being never ever eating or using something that may have exploited an animal, it's just about reducing your impact.Speaking of impact, the other big reason to stop eating animals (or really, just eat less animals) is that animal agriculture is not good for Mother Earth. Do you enjoy having a planet to live on? Me too! Consider cooling it with the Big Macs. I'm sorry for eating this meat in front of you.You don't have to be. For much of my life, my diet was pretty much animal products and processed bread. I only really got serious about eating more plants (that weren't potatoes) when I started running. I get it. I know giving up meat, much less all animal products, sounds really intimidating, but even reducing the amount you consume, if you're so inclined, will make a huge difference for you personally, for animals and for the planet. ", :image_url=>"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/566266fce4b04e4daff1eae1/1511807889538-WNIBBHDE4HYB966GSPF8/Screen+Shot+2017-11-27+at+12.37.43+PM.png?format=500w"},

Candle lighting and sand pouring feel too cheesy. We're a flippant couple, but I can't bring myself to be so aloof as to do away with the ceremony entirely.

I am walking myself down the aisle because no matter how sweet of sentiment lies in the tradition of a father giving away his daughter has become, I cannot ignore its roots in the patriarchy. I am walking myself down the aisle, and because of it I am worried my dad feels like he's missing out.

Whether or not I can make it across the busy intersection or if I need to go a little ways down the side street.Does it hurt your [body part]?Yes, sometimes, a little. Have you always been a runner?Nope! Running has always been my preferred form of exercise when forced to pick, but that's just because I lack strength, aim, speed and coordination. While social pressure had me participating in track and cross country in junior high and I did walk-run intervals (that were primarily walking) on the treadmill throughout high school and college summers, I was never a habitual runner and I never went further than a 5k. Then I graduated from college and I had a lot free time, which I initially filled with eating out and drinking. That was fun for about six months, even though it was making me poor and fat. Then the novelty wore off and it was pretty much just making me poor and fat. I initially ran to fix the fat part, but I started liking it and did it so much that it helped the poor part, too. (Marathon registration is equivalent to about four dinners and drinks.) Do you have to stop to go to the bathroom when you're running for a long time?It's the one consistent in my life. The three things bears and I have in common: Furry, may attack unprovoked, and shit in the woods. Since you run so much, can you just eat whatever you want? No. The depressing thing about sports nutrition is that when you reach the point where you need to eat an insane amount of food just to fuel your run is that said insane amount of food has to have decent nutritional value. I by no means subsist solely on veggies and chicken breasts, but in order to have the energy to run (without shitting myself), I can only have about half of the pastries and ice cream I would like to. Excessively greasy food is also out. You're gonna go run in this weather?Yep. The treadmill is to be avoided at nearly all costs. When it's truly too frigid/windy/wet to run outdoors and the workout can't be deferred, I can handle about an hour on the treadmill, which is longer than most runners who are accustomed to running outside are willing to go. Also, I primarily get people reacting with surprise when I'm running in the cold, but what non-runners often don't realize is a 30-degree run is often more comfortable than a 70-degree run—especially after the first couple miles. Do you get a runner's high?Absolutely, and I think most people who claim they don't get one haven't actually run long enough to hit it—mine seems to kick in around mile six (sorry, people trying to get into running, I know that's not what you want to hear). And of course, it doesn't always happen during the run, but there is no better tired than the tired you are the afternoon following your weekend long run.Now that you've done [race], are you going to do [other race]?I ran my first-ever half on May 1, 2016. People asked if I was going to do another, and I did. People asked if I was ever going to do a full marathon, and, two weeks ago, I did. Now people are asking if I'll do another marathon. (Probably, but I doubt it will be in the next year.) Some people even ask if I'll ever do an ultra marathon. (Unlikely, but stranger things have happened—like me running a marathon, period.) Not to get all Michael Bolton, but as cool as it is to know that I can Go the Distance, at some point, it has to be a little less about harder/better/faster/stronger and more about just chasing the aforementioned high. Because, in answer to the most frequently asked question, yes, I do actually enjoy running. ", :image_url=>"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/566266fce4b04e4daff1eae1/1495382298765-NORFLDHBIOWSRQ4ZUUO0/unnamed.jpg?format=500w"},

Last night, I watched the final two (sadly Adam Driver-less) episodes of the both season six and the entire series. My spoiler-free review: Ugh. But really, are any of us surprised?The end of Girls was not a How I Met Your Mother situation, where a terrible final season and surprising and unfitting ending ruined a previously enjoyable eight seasons, or a Glee scenario in which a decent show slowly and steadily became unwatchable. The things that make the series so frustrating to watch are present start to finish, and by things I mean the characters.The entire show is a dramedy about the experiences of a group of girls in their early 20s, which, as a girl in my early 20s, you'd think I'd be poised to enjoy, but the four eponymous girls in Girls are all so unlikable that, not only can I not relate to them, I can't pick which one I dislike the least. Shoshanna is maybe the least despicable, but she's still annoying and uncompelling at best. Jessa is essentially a standard Coachella attendee, who somehow manages to look upon all her fellow festival goers with contempt. Marnie is the beautiful yet self-absorbed and stuck up shrew that caricatures of rich housewives on comedy shows aspire to be. And then there's Hannah, who somehow manages to encapsulate all of the worst traits of the other three. She's annoying, pretentious and selfish, and her shenanigans are somehow more ridiculous than those of Ilana and Abbi of Broad City—characters who are intentionally ridiculous and farcical, and yet still more relatable and likable than the main characters of Girls, who, at least based on the show's tone, are meant to at least partially represent the personalities and experiences of actual 20-something women. With each episode, I found myself wondering if there ever was a show with less likable characters. Maybe a miniseries about the Third Reich, if the producers cut all the Schindler's List-y plotlines. But I will say this for Girls: Despite hating everyone in the damn show, I still watched it all, and am still talking about it, so I guess Lena and Judd win, albeit on a technicality. The kicker is that the penultimate episode, \"Goodbye Tour\", made me reconsider my assessment of the series. Between Shoshanna's declaration that she's moved on from her toxic relationships with the other three girls and Hannah and Jessa's final conversation acknowledging their mutual flaws, the characters, and more importantly, the series showed an unprecedented self-awareness. As I watched the girls dance around in Shoshanna's apartment, having seemingly made their peace with each other, I wondered: Could it be that six seasons' worth of mildly entertaining petty drama between irredeemably irksome characters was finally being paid off with this improbably heartwarming conclusion that also served as a commentary on the imperfect but still beautiful nature of humanity?  Nope. The finale showed us Hannah and Marnie, now raising Hannah's baby, and somehow as terrible as ever. The moral of the story changed from \"these absurdly irritating characters have reached some semblance of cognizance and we can hope that they will go on to be incrementally less irritating in their fictional futures\" to \"these absurdly irritating characters will always be exactly as irritating as they were at the beginning of the series, though it will become even more unrealistic and unlikable as they age.\" Sorry Girls—when I'm in the mood for the zany antics of young women living in New York, I'll be tuning in to the much funnier (and somehow still much more genuine) Broad City. ", :image_url=>""},

I was always short, slow and stumbling. I was a bad catch and a worse throw, always aiming for \"not dead last.\" What I lacked in athletic ability I made up for in academic achievement. I was an advanced reader. I could write and spell and memorize historical dates. Math wasn't my strongest subject but even that I was better at than the average student. I wasn't sporty, but I was smart. I got plenty of praise for how thoughtful and bright I was, so who cared if I went out for volleyball?I embraced the narrative that my parents, teachers and friends all crafted for me—good at school, bad at sports. No one ever told me I couldn't do it—but because I was good at certain things naturally, no one ever pushed me to become better at the things that didn't come so easily. There were times that I resented my parents for not forcing me to play sports. Sometimes this stemmed from feeling left out of the cultural zeitgeist (probably the closest I'll ever come to understanding what it's like to be an actual minority is being categorically disinterested in Husker football while living in Nebraska), and sometimes it came from the deep-down knowledge that I'd rarely been challenged and the ensuing fear that, when I was, I would be unprepared and come up short.A huge step on the road to growing the fuck up, though, is taking ownership of your deficiencies. For me, it was a total non-epiphany. I can't pinpoint a specific instance that triggered the realization that, while I can surround myself with people who unfailingly push me to be better than I was the day before, I am the only one who can demand true excellence of myself. If there was a specific moment, maybe it was so seemingly mundane, I let it pass me by. More likely it was the culmination of thousands of miles run and hundreds of yoga classes, where I read the same mantra written on the bathroom wall: We can do hard things. Anyone who's talked to me more than twice knows I'm a fairly unsentimental person. I'm not what you'd call the mantra type, but now that I have three half marathons under my belt and am 18-mile long runs deep into my marathon training, it seems fitting. It's my response to friends, family and casual acquaintances who express amazement at how far I've come, and it's my response to myself when I get nervous thinking about how far I still have to go. It's true that you need to be in a certain physical condition to run any long distance, or embark on any number of other athletic endeavors, and getting there is a lengthy process. More important, though, is unlearning some of the stories about yourself that you and others have created, and that process is significantly more challenging. My marathon training does not seem easy. The thought of running for four (and maybe closer to five) hours nonstop still terrifies me—but it also excites me. To all the people who have been asking why, I say: Why not? We can do hard things. So let's try.  ", :image_url=>"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/566266fce4b04e4daff1eae1/1487537619464-B6BXP5BKRR0TL1W0I09H/unnamed.jpg?format=500w"},

Sometimes I fantasize about going to grad school to continue my philosophy degree. I basically already have the wardrobe (lots of shabby sweaters), and maybe this time I'd do better at fulfilling the stoned philosopher stereotype. But then I remember that I'd have to take the GRE, which sounds like a real downer, and also I like being able to afford fine luxuries, like food that isn't ramen noodles. Despite its day-to-day uselessness, my philosophical education is not something I regret when I reflect on college. (Edward Winehands, however...) Even though there's really no place for a discussion of scientific realism or cultural relativism in the office, I was introduced to several aspects of philosophy that have ultimately shaped the way I see the world, including: Psychological egosim: This is the view that people are always, ultimately, motivated by their self-interest. This position turns people off because it claims even the most altruistic acts are performed for selfish reasons. For example: You see a homeless person begging on the street and give him your shoes. And we're not talking nasty Crocs. We're talking, like swanky Brooks Brothers loafers, or whatever it is middle-aged rich white dudes wear! You gave them away, to a stranger in need, out of the goodness of your heart. And not at all because doing something so nice makes you feel good. Yeah, right, says the psychological egoist (and I). Symbolic logic: Even though symbolic logic isn't a philosophical view or argument (it's basically calculus), my logic course changed my worldview by making me reconsider my longstanding belief that I'm bad at math. And, despite having forgotten pretty much everything I learned, today it gives me hope that I could always learn how to code if writing becomes an obsolete skill.Anarchy: Ready to like government even less than you already do? This is probably the best book I read in my undergraduate career. It's very accessible compared to other philosophical texts and makes the reader reconsider the role of government in a context so much broader than conservative-vs.-liberal. It skips the debate over whether women and minorities should be denied basic human rights because Don't Tread On Me (or whatever justification those wacky Republicans are spouting these days) and gets to the heart of the philosophical issue concerning government: What gives the government its authority? And once you read it, you feel so much more entitled to enjoy the Sex Pistols. The problem of evil: If you've ever questioned how an all-loving and all-powerful God could let good people die or terrible disasters strike, you've already begun to ponder the problem of evil, the philosophical question that attempts to reconcile the existence of evil with the existence of a God that is infinitely good and capable of preventing evil. I don't remember the last time I went to church, so you can probably guess what I think of any proposed solutions to this problem on the part of the theist.Determinism: According to determinism, every action we take is caused by prior events, and, with these conditions being such that they are, we couldn't have taken any other action. Therefore, we do not have free will. This is another position that lots of people, myself included, initially reject. After all, we all want to think our future is totally open-ended—maybe we'll pack a salad for lunch tomorrow, instead of going to McDonald's for the third day in the row. But the sad truth is, because of the other circumstances in our lives, we were never going to actually pack that salad. We were always gonna be shame eating those McNuggets in our car. Parents, Fox News was right. Send your children to liberal arts colleges, and they WILL return to you anarchist atheists with acute depressive disorders. Perhaps more worryingly, they will also know a bunch of words you don't.   ", :image_url=>""},

There's no signage that's actually handwritten at Starbucks, only signage that's meant to look like it. As she was thinking about Starbucks corporate and all the people who were, for better or worse, simply one small part of that great machine, she suddenly could not articulate to herself why she was at the coffeeshop.It was a wholly metaphysical mystery. The most literal explanation for her location was: It was the lunch hour, and she’d wanted to get out of the office. She wanted a double latte, and maybe one of the deli sandwiches double wrapped with saran and wax paper. But as she waited, eyes glazed, she began to question the various minutia of her life that had brought her to this moment. She looked down at her shoes, and she wondered how her decision to wear these shoes, on this day, and even to buy them in the first place, fit with the other pieces of her life. She thought of the work she had to do when she got back to the office. She thought of the petty dramas occurring between her friends. It all felt far away, like the plot of a book she’d read or a movie she’d watched that she’d been engrossed in at the time, but now it seemed to have no bearing on who she was in this moment.What would happen, she thought, if she didn’t return to work. If she didn’t return to her home. The cat, surely, wouldn’t notice so long as her roommate continued to feed him. How far would her second-hand car, with its 120,000-plus miles, get her? How long would her money (probably close to $10,000 spread between several savings and checking accounts) last her? Where could she go, and what could she do? Who could she be if she shed her current life like a cicada shell? Was it possible, she wondered, to shrug off 20-odd years of living and walk away unscathed?The line advanced. She thought, bitterly, if this were happening to a man the story would be the next American classic. It would be the beginning of an epic coming-of-age tale, with some great moral about the nature of the human spirit. But because it was happening to her, it was simply melodrama. White girl problems, she thought, and felt a little like laughing and a little like crying. She plumbed the depths of her subconscious in search of the source of these feelings. Just minutes ago, she had been content, perhaps even pleased, with the life she’d created for herself. But then, she asked herself, could she really claim something as active as creation in regards to her life? The question and the ensuing answer washed over her like some sort of Arctic tsunami, leaving her extremities feeling numb. The brutal truth of it: When she imagined her life taking form, she saw herself less as an artist carefully painting a masterpiece, and more as a toddler scribbling with crayons on the wall. She recoiled from this revelation and looked up at the barista, who was awaiting her order. She looked for some sort of answer in this stranger's eyes, hoping her desperation was not apparent. The visible pieces of the barista’s identity—oversized sweater, chunky glasses, beanie and bright red lips—all fit together seamlessly, and she wondered if the other girl’s insides were as well-matched, or, if like hers, they sometimes felt like they had been forcibly mashed into each other. She ordered a double latte and a chicken salad sandwich. She sat down at a table by the window and took our her laptop. She pulled up Facebook and began reading comments on one of her friend’s (a college classmate she hadn’t spoken to since probably before graduation) statuses. She finished her sandwich as she checked her Twitter notifications (two new favorites on her latest tweet about the tribulations of the morning's commute) and she gave her LinkedIn a cursory glance as she downed the dregs of her lukewarm latte. She packed up and headed back to the office. ", :image_url=>""},

Case in point: There's not a dude on the homepage of popcornshirt.com. I don't know what's more baffling: The existence of popcorn shirts, the existence of a site devoted solely to selling them or said site's audacious claim that popcorn shirts are flattering on everybody. I can't think of a good reason for any of this, other than that there is no god. A few other fashion-related puzzlements I'd be glad to hear some explanation for: Why I can't find dress pants. I feel it's unfair that I can fluctuate between two to four pant sizes (depending on the store) and remain unable to fit a pair of dress pants that fit me. I was recently excited to be having the very terrible #FirstWorldProblem of having to decide if a 0 or a 2 fit me better at Express, until I realized that I could lose every ounce of fat on my body and I would still be stuck between pants that were either slightly too baggy or too tight to scream Young Professional. And in either case: Said pants have to be ankle pants, because those are the only kind that I can buy without having hemmed. Why we don't have a word for dress pants that isn't \"slacks.\" Slacks is for me what moist is for 95% of the populace. Urban Decay's branding. I love Urban Decay. It's the only makeup I've used for years now. (Their Naked palettes and eye primer, in particular, are amazing.) The main downside of using Urban Decay products is their edgelord branding, including, but not limited to, lipstick with shade names like Gash, eyeliners called Walk of Shame and eyeshadow colors such as Asphyxia. While these shade names might be helpful to, say, My Chemical Romance as they're hard at work writing the next anthem for white, upper middle class 14-year-olds everywhere, I, a white, upper middle class 24-year-old, am at least self aware enough to feel more than a little tool-y whilst applying an eyeshadow named Sin.  Cloth to price ratio. It seems like the sheerer something is, the more I am expected to pay for it. Some of the most expensive women's clothing items are lingerie and bikinis, which, by design, do not involve a lot of coverage. Don't worry, my previously expressed desire to have this explained to me is mostly rhetorical; I know that I can thank the patriarchy for this one. Why American Eagle wants me to buy jeggings so badly. American Eagle, I am a repeat customer because your jeans—your actual denim pants, a clothing item that you may recognize as somewhat popular with the masses—fit me great no matter what size I am at the time, and you always have short sizes in your stores. But you prefer to ignore my commitment to your jeans, hiding them further back in the store, and push your stupid jeggings in my face. Listen: When I wear jeans, it's because I don't want to be wearing leggings, and when I wear leggings, it's because I don't want to be wearing jeans. Never have I ever wished I was wearing some gross amalgam of the two. Leggings controversy. I think the whole \"do leggings count as pants\" debate has died down in recent years, but in case anyone is wondering we were landed on that: Yes, yes they do. Guys who don't think legging count as pants: Your opinion is meaningless. Girls who don't think leggings count as pants: Who hurt you? Animal print. I understand that it's not against the Rules of Fashion™, but I personally think it should be. But to close on a happy note: I am vindicated by a recent turn in men's fashion! Finally something is being done about cargo shorts. We can only pray that the same may soon be said of ugly shoes. EDITOR'S NOTE: Though this post's title may imply otherwise, the author has never attempted to wear a pleather crop top and has no intention to actually do so. ", :image_url=>""},

  {:title=>"You Stopped Reading This Because It Got Too Political", :date=>"2016-10-20", :summary=>"I don't like talking about politics.", :body=>"I was interested in a political science major right up until I found myself enrolled in a five-person, discussion-based, current political issues class the first semester of my freshman year. It was there I discovered that I really don't enjoy talking politics, even in the most civil of circumstances, even with people who agree with me. Considering I have lots of Opinions and am always ready to fight someone, you'd think political discourse would be right up my alley, but not so.Lost cause. I think it's because talking about politics is just no fun. I guess I just feel like my time is better spent dressing up my cat and then tweeting excessively about it. I'm also generally able to at least understand and accept differing views—even if I think said different views are for stupid heads—and, again, I would rather spend the hours of my life that could be wasted getting in a fight in the comments section on attempting to leash train Gruber. In this utter shitmess of an election, I've been noticing a lot of calls for everyone to just get along. I've been seeing posts from lots of people saying that they won't stop being friends with anyone over political differences. Generally, I'd agree with that and resume selecting the perfect Insta filter to wow anyone browsing the #CatsOfInstagram.But this election year, I don't want to agree to disagree. In fact, I've been automatically unfriending everyone on my Facebook or Twitter (thus far all casual acquaintances) who's expressed support for Donald Trump.Do I respect a person's right to do something as shameful as support Trump and further shame themselves by expressing that support? Absolutely. Do I want to associate with a person like that? Absolutely not.Here's why:Donald Trump is an oppressor of women. Donald Trump is an oppressor of minorities. \"If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.\" So here I am, talking about politics. There are endless reasons why the American people should not elect Trump. While I regret invoking Godwin's law in the midst of what might be an already-controversial sentiment, I truly believe that history will come to view Trump supporters similarly in the same light as Nazis. (Gee, I wonder why!) If you support Donald Trump for president, let's not agree to disagree. Let's agree to part ways.  ", :image_url=>""},

I know your name is Greg, because you’ve presumably been coming to yoga classes at my studio long enough and consistently enough that the teachers compliment you by name. Greg, I really like how we always put our mats next to each other. It makes me feel like we are friends, even though you probably don’t know my name, because I tend to get complimented by name a little less than you do. Greg, I wonder how you mentally refer to me. Am I Short Girl Who For Some Reason Always Puts Her Mat By Mine? That Chick Who Always Sweats Way More Than the Rest Of Us? The Woman With No Upper Body Strength Who Is Clearly Just Trying Her Best (And Failing)?Greg, please stop taking all those extra chaturanga dandasanas. It’s giving me a complex.Greg, I am often smug when we are doing poses that I am automatically better at than you because of your boy parts. Don’t worry, Greg, I feel this way about all male yogis. It doesn’t really make up for the pay gap, but it does take some of the sting out of it. Greg, when I attempt a shitty crow pose or lift myself into a mediocre wheel and you look at me with that grin on your face, I have a choice. I can believe you are looking at me with mingled fondness and pride, seeing how I have grown in my yoga practice, or I can believe you are laughing at me. I choose to believe the former, because sometimes self delusion is necessary in order to cling to the tattered shards of my self-esteem. Greg, you wear the same outfit to literally every class. Like, not the same basic ensemble, but, as far as I can tell, the same specific clothing items. Whether you have several sets of the same pants and shirt, or you’re just washing them very, very frequently, I’m not sure. While your attire is a source of curiosity for me, I’m not disgusted because I would definitely be able to tell if your identical outfits were unwashed. Greg, unlike many male yogis, you never smell like BO. You actually probably smell less like BO than me, because of course you do. Way to hygiene, Greg.Greg, I think you are married because I’ve spotted a ring on your finger. I wonder about your wife. Does she practice yoga? Why does she never come with you? Are you just on different schedules? Maybe it’s that you’re a night owl and she’s a morning person. Or maybe she hates yoga. Maybe she’s too busy with work. Or maybe she’s always taking care of your kids and doesn’t have time to go to yoga class. God, Greg! Can’t the woman have any time for herself? You are such a dick. Greg, I really hope you never read this because you will probably be super weirded out, but I like to think that if you do, you’ll find this all very endearing and humorous and continue to put your mat next to mine.

You don't have to listen to me; you can continue annoying anyone who hasn't finally just gotten around to unfollowing you yet. Your profile picture should feature you. It can be you alone or with others. It may also feature your beloved pet or douchey vehicle, but you have to be in it too. Do not post any text long enough to merit a \"Keep Reading\" cut. If your status update is more than three-to-four sentences, it is too deep, fam. Facebook is just not the place to bare your soul, no matter how sincere you are trying to be. Do you really want all the people you met at that one thing you went to a few years back, friended and then never spoke to again to read your paragraphs-long write up about your most recent existential crisis, then continue scrolling to see one of those mesmerizing Tasty videos and promptly forget about it? Save it for your blog, or better yet, a conversation with a few close friends after you've all gotten wine drunk. Note the names of the pages you're sharing things from. Are you sharing photos or videos from a page named \"Looks Like Mama's Having Another Hot Flash\" or the \"Midwest Skinheads Association\"? And are you really okay with what that says about you?If you are updating your status daily (or more frequently) on a regular basis, don't. It's nice to give people the illusion that you have better things to do. Do not be the person who only takes to Twitter when sad or mad. You know who you are, and you need to quit it. I don't want to see your \"Alone again :( I guess everyone leaves eventually\"s or your \"When someone stabs you in the back <<<<<\"s and all your other subtweets. It makes you look immature and makes me think you deserve all the loneliness and betrayal the world has seen fit to inflict upon you.I swear to God if you retweet another Vine video we are done here. DONE, do you hear me? Pace yourself. Maybe you've spent the last couple months forgetting you ever had a Twitter, but reappearing to tweet five times in an hour span after your social media amnesia wears off is really irritating. Consistency is key. You don't need to hashtag everything in the photo. I promise! About three hashtags should suffice. EXCEPTION: If your account is partially for promotion purposes and you're trying to get noticed for your fitness/art/music/style, etc. stuff. But in that case, it's just common courtesy to put that stuff a few returns below the caption or in a comment. Less is more. Aesthetic is the whole point of Instagram, so I would really appreciate it if you tried to apply some artistry to your photos. But not too much. Edit your photo enough that we can tell, but not so much that you couldn't use #nofilter and not get called out. Stagger the release of your photos. I don't want to see 15 photos of your latest trip or night out on the town in a row on my feed. #latergram exists for a reason.There it is, folks.

For one thing, I’m always looking to improve my wine knowledge (if by “improve my knowledge” you mean “drink more wine”). And I recently ran my first half-marathon, and I do want to run a full some day (and let’s be real, if it doesn’t happen in the next seven years, I’m not sure it’s going to).But just because I’m on board with some of these doesn’t mean they’re universal. What if I hated running? Or was physically incapable of running due to an injury or disability? Running 26.2 miles, to say nothing of all the miles you have to run to prepare to run 26.2 miles, isn’t for everyone.A lot of these lists also include travel. Traveling is great! I’ve been abroad twice in 2016 and hope to be abroad many more times before I’m 30/50/dead, but these lists come off somewhat presumptuous, because for a lot of people my age—and, honestly, just a lot of people—travel isn’t affordable or feasible.Another popular item on these types of lists is relocating. Move somewhere totally new! Where you don’t know anyone! Establish yourself in a different city or state or even country to find out who you really are! It does sound neat, except...what if I’m happy here? I don’t know where life will take me and I’m always up for a new adventure, but as of now, I’m probably gonna be born, live and die in the same 100-mile radius. Which, depending on your situation, might sound really terrible, but for me, it doesn’t suck.These lists go on and on. I could make a list of all the lists! Here’s another, 25 Things You Should Do Before 25. Shit, guys. I apparently only have about a year to learn to cook a three-course meal suitable for a small dinner party, develop a green thumb, learn a new language and watch about 70 movies. See you in 2018.Point is: These lists are arbitrary and silly. They often make people feel bad for 1) not being realistically able to do things they’d like to do or 2) not doing something they have no interest in doing. Which is dumb. Listen, internet authors, my bucket list =/= your bucket list. While I may or may not want to hear about what life experiences you’ve found valuable, I’m definitely not interested in feeling like I’m not dreaming big enough or like I’ve missed an opportunity.In the wise words of Albus Dumbledore, “It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.” So, in the also-wise words of Tim McGraw, go skydiving, rocky mountain climbing...I don’t know why anyone would actually want to go 2.7 seconds on a bull name Fumanchu, or what that even means, but if that’s part of your bucket list, go for it.

The living in a perpetual state of wanting to lose five-to-10 pounds kind, the \"I couldn't wear that\" kind, the counting calories kind. You know, the kind most women (and a fair amount of men) have. I've tried to flatten my stomach by sheer force of will. I've scrubbed my face raw trying to stave off the acne my period brings. I've stuffed my boobs into bras that lift, separate, provide a more pleasing silhouette. But I don't hate my body. Actually, I generally feel pretty all right about it. Sometimes I just wish I could blink and change a bunch of things about it. You know, normal stuff. Everyone should feel good about their body, I believe that. Still I find myself judging another person (usually another woman) based on their physical appearance. (Forgive me, Mother, for I have sinned.) Is it because I'm really just a superficial bitch?  Or worse—is this my internalized misogyny speaking? Best case scenario: I am just too cynical for the body positivity movement. While it's unrealistic to hold any woman—or even any person—to the photoshopped, Uncanny Valley-esque images we're confronted with daily, it's equally unrealistic for a person to wake up, every single day, and go about their day, not wishing something about their physicality was different. It's unrealistic to never make snap judgements about people based on how they look, no matter how much we tell ourselves it's what's on the inside that counts. (Sorry, but anyone wearing an Affliction shirt will never not come off as a douche, no matter how great they may actually be.) My possible internalized misogyny and definite cynicism aside: I feel mostly good about my body, most days, and I want other people to feel that way about themselves. We can't control what other people think about us. We can't even always control what we think about us, but I think if we can just cool it when it comes to our own appearances, we can also be less bitchy about other peoples'. I'm not really into \"the power of positive self talk\", personally, but there are two key, less cheesy things that have greatly improved my body acceptance, if not given me total body positivity. The first thing came in college, which is somewhat ironic, since I probably gained around 20 pounds during undergrad. (On my 5'1\" frame, I might add.) Despite my flab exponentially increasing due to a diet primarily consisting of gin and DeLeon's, I spent my four years at Doane College becoming more and more comfortable in my own skin. Contrary to what popular media may indicate about Greek life, I credit this increase in body acceptance to joining a sorority. You might expect that I'm about to reveal that sororities at liberal arts colleges in small-town Nebraska are secret hotbeds of radical feminism. Not really. You might think that this body acceptance came from learning about myself through the power of sisterhood. Maybe a little. But the real reason joining a sorority helped me stop giving so much of a shit about my muffin top is that I was just really exposed to naked chicks, like, all the time. I lived with seven of my sisters in close quarters, and we were often casually nude. There were No Pants Sundays and team showers and times when we stayed up too late and just thought it was funny to sit around in the common area butt-ass naked. There was plenty of nudity as a larger group, too. Girls got hot during long meetings and took their shirts off. They got drunk at parties and decided to go streaking. As sexy as I may be making this sound, this was never the stuff of a frat guy fantasy; it was just a buncha ladies being comfortable around each other, with body types ranging from fashion model to BBW.It didn't really matter if I felt like, objectively, one of my sisters had a \"better\" body than me or not. Just existing around another person while both of you are in a state of undress and feeling utterly relaxed about it is freeing. Like, fuck it! Who cares that society thinks one of us can pull off a bikini better than the other? We're sitting naked on the futon. (Which is disgusting, because Things Have Happened on this futon.) The second thing that's helped me come to terms with the sack of flesh and bones I inhabit every day is actually taking care of it. About six months after I graduated, I gradually began weaning myself off booze and late night Tex-Mex. I didn't really do this for health, but for the same reason most people \"get healthy\": Losing weight. I started running. A lot. I started working towards a half marathon, and with all the hours I spent running, there was less and less time to go out and drink. I was more and more inclined to eat things that wouldn't cause explosive diarrhea mid-run. I started going to yoga classes regularly, because it was a good way to stretch out my hips, the mobility of which had begun to resemble that of an 80-year-old. And now I've lost most of that college weight, and, since I was always much more of a theater kid than an athlete, I'm in the best shape of my life. (Which is admittedly only relatively impressive.) The cool part about this, though, is what started off as \"I need to stop being so Goddamn fat\" has transformed into \"I need to keep getting stronger.\" I have never even though of myself as capable of being physically fit, but somewhere in between all the frigid runs and the hot yoga, physical fitness has taken priority over skinniness. When it's hot, I run outside in nothing but a sports bra, even though I'm aware some passersby might think I'm not skinny enough to pull that look off. They can suck it, it's hot and I'm on mile six of eight. Fellow ladies, your fitness is more important than your appearance, and the latter is not necessarily a reflection of the former. I will not judge you for wearing something that is comfortable for you to do your thing in, even if it doesn't accentuate your curves or hide your \"problem areas.\" And if I do, shame on me. Because while I'm pretty accepting (and these days even sometimes adoring) of my body, those issues don't just disappear after an inspirational training montage, and the shittiest thing about our own insecurity is the way we project it on others. Do I still want to lose five pounds? It wouldn't suck. I'll never stop wanting a flat stomach, but as long as I can run for miles or hold a plank, I can deal with what I've got. Besides, I've started to notice something that might be the beginning of a visible ab. ", :image_url=>"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/566266fce4b04e4daff1eae1/1466523760251-V9TVGQ99MMAYJUMQ1U5W/Screen+Shot+2016-06-21+at+10.42.19+AM.png?format=500w"},

That’s why we’ve all been communicating via crudely drawn cave paintings and putting an “e” at the end of “old” up until this exact moment in history. If you’re having trouble talking to the millennials in your office, home or local coffeeshop, don’t worry! The internet is really obsessed with helping you understand our indecipherable gibberish. I’m baffled. Is this really that big of an issue? Older generations, are you really struggling that much to discern and appropriately parrot what we’re saying? Also, why do y’all care so much? I’m beginning to suspect there’s some insidious Baby Boomer plot at work here. Not sure what exactly that plot is...perhaps it involves sticking us with tons of student debt we had to accrue in an attempt to enter a saturated job market short on decent jobs and forcing us to pay for their retirement and benefits with no hope of seeing the same? (Nah, I’m not #salty.) As a millennial by every measurement of the demographic, I do feel duty-bound to inform any Baby Boomers or Gen Xers reading these articles that half of these words and terms are foreign to me. Also, these article headlines are giving much so much secondhand embarrassment, to say nothing of the “explanations” of the slang itself. Sure, they’re not Hillary-referencing-Beyoncé-in-a-desperate-attempt-to pander-to-youth voters-level embarrassing, but I’m cringing all the same.What baffles me is the implied lack of any capability on the part of non-millennials to use context clues. If I tell you “I’m trying get a good pic for Instagram”, can you not infer that I’m doing something involving a social media application? When you see someone refer to someone/thing as “bae” accompanied by the heart eyes emoji, doesn’t it stand to reason that bae is some term of endearment? Even if you don’t know what I mean when I say I’m salty, surely my tone or general demeanor indicates that “salty” means I’m somehow displeased? (Used in a sentence: I’m salty that there are so many inane articles about decoding “millennial speak” when it’s honestly not that hard to figure out what we’re talking about.)Another thing that seems to be lost on the authors of these articles is that a lot of millennials use a lot of these terms somewhat ironically. For example, I would not say “Oh my God I am gonna get so turnt tonight” while actually talking about my plans for a night of drinking, but I might say it while talking about my plans to eat five cookies and go to bed at 9. Another thing I might say: “Let’s get turnt for Jesus!” Hilarious and blasphemous. What I’m getting at here is that “turnt” on its own is not a funny joke, but it’s the kind of word I’d only use when making some sort of mildly humorous comment. Yes, there are millennials among us who not only would use turnt unironically in a casual setting, but also think it’s appropriate for a professional setting. But since I don’t judge all Baby Boomers for the sins of a single one of them who can’t figure out how to stop sending their Slack messages to the entire company, I in turn expect that no dumbassery of someone who just happens to be my approximate age is automatically held against me. Key takeaways—or, as we millennials might say, the tl;dr—for the old and crusty (and the old and crusty at heart):Use context clues to understand the meaning of generational slang.“Bitz” is not a hot millennial word just because an article on the internet says it is.If using a certain term or phrase feels uncomfortable, you’re probably making the Youths uncomfortable by using it.There.

  {:title=>"Requiem For a Business Luncheon", :date=>"2016-05-20", :summary=>"Like an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, the following story is fictional and does not depict any actual person or event.", :body=>"You enter the hotel, your heels already rubbing the back of your foot raw and pinching your toes uncomfortably. You’re dressed about 87% more professionally than you normally would be, because today is a special (in this case, special meaning “sounded like a good thing to commit to at the time but now I don’t have time for this”) occasion: You have a business luncheon to attend.You pick up your name tag at the registration booth quickly and quietly, doing your best to avoid the group of people making small talk in the foyer. Upon entering the conference room, you immediately begin scouting for a table of people who look unlikely to insist on feeble attempts at networking and instead let you and your fellow table mates sit in mildly uncomfortable silence while you ponder how soon is too soon to begin picking at your wilting mixed greens salad. You spy a table of eight that has only four occupants. There is a middle-aged man who exudes an aura of total defeat, seated next to a college-aged woman who looks about as socially anxious as you feel and, with a buffer seat between them and the man, two women with talon-like manicures who seem to be from the same company, talking to each other intermittently while scrolling through their Instagrams. These are your people. You power walk to the table, and sit across from the man, whose name tag identifies him as Randy. As you are placing your napkin on your lap and fidgeting with your silverware, you make eye contact with Randy. In his eyes, you can see the reflection of one too many rubbery chicken and lukewarm potatoes luncheon meals staring back at you. His eyes are hollow, haunted. The young woman next to him, who does not have a name tag and is presumably his intern, glances at you nervously, perhaps afraid you will try to ask her about her future career aspirations.Everything is going reasonably well until Jessica decides to join your table. Jessica is Very Excited To Be Here and Really Looking Forward to Making Professional Connections. She insists on asking everyone “who they are with” even though this is information she could obtain by glancing at their name tags, and everyone’s nearly identical job duties sound “really fascinating.” Sure, Jessica. You feel your body shifting in its seat, straining to move as far as possible from her obnoxious eagerness to meet new people and you grab a second stale bread roll and begin aggressively chewing it in an effort to indicate that, like a reality TV show contestant, you’re not here to make friends. The meal is being served as the luncheon organizer steps up to the podium and begins welcoming the attendees in the least welcoming voice imaginable. You look down at the plate in front of you. To no one’s surprise, today’s menu consists of rubbery chicken and lukewarm potatoes. You glance at Randy, wondering if this is what will finally break him once and for all, but he simply begins cutting into his chicken with dead eyes and practiced motions. About the time the keynote speaker takes the podium, you begin to wonder if anyone has ever considered serving booze at these luncheons. Or if there is a profession where booze is always served at these luncheons, and how easily you could move to said profession. Next to you, Jessica is twisted in her seat so she has eyes on the speaker and his poorly formatted PowerPoint. You remain facing away, staring at the condensation that’s formed on your water glass. Ideally, you are giving off the impression that you are listening intently, carefully processing all that’s being said, but more likely you just look like you’re mad about being here. While you’re not rude enough to be blatantly perusing Facebook during this dull, dull time, you are developing a certain grudging respect for those around you who are.A small amount of laughter at one of the speaker’s bad jokes breaks out in the room. You force your face muscles to form something that you hope resembles a smile. Finally, it ends. You want to jump from your seat and sprint out of the hotel, but you force yourself to stand at a normal speed and, using all of your remaining willpower, walk briskly to the door. Factoring in travel time, the luncheon is one of the longest lunch breaks you’ve ever taken, though it’s really no break at all, but rather an hour-and-a-half-long session of slow death by boredom. Still, as you inhale sweet, fresh oxygen into lungs that have begun adapting to the stale conference room air, you find yourself newly appreciative of your freedom. And tomorrow you can wear jeans to work again. You smile to yourself. It’s always good to have something to wake up for in the morning.  ", :image_url=>""},

Now my Facebook and Twitter feeds are a-brimmin' with sentimental posts from this year's seniors. Before you guys get too depressed, though, I have some unsolicited reassurance and life advice to offer you.", :body=>"Almost a year ago, I graduated from college. Now my Facebook and Twitter feeds are a-brimmin' with sentimental posts from this year's seniors. Before you guys get too depressed, though, I have some unsolicited reassurance and life advice to offer you. (Classic me!)About friends: I'm gonna say the sad thing that you all already know: Some of your friends will just kind of fall away from you after graduation. That's okay. It doesn't mean that your friendship meant nothing, and it doesn't mean you're going to slowly lose everyone. What you don't realize in college is that you'll continue to meet people your entire life. And of course there'll be friends you stay close with, but one thing you have to keep in mind is that the dynamic of friendship changes once you graduate. In college, best friendship for me meant I saw a person at least multiple times a day. We used the same bathroom and shared meals on a daily basis. We probably got drunk together at least once a week and we probably spent at least 10 hours a week watching Law and Order: Special Victims Unit together. While I miss that kind of friendship, I think once you graduate, that kind of friendship stops being realistic for most people. You don't live with all your friends any more. You probably have your own bathroom and you probably either eat most of your meals alone or with your significant other. But if your friendship is strong, you will still be friends with someone even if you only see them once a month for dinner or coffee. About responsibilities: If you were supporting yourself 100% through college, you are a total badass. If you've been graduated for five years and your parents still fork over cash for your rent, well, hey, good for you, smoke 'em if you got 'em, etc. I went from supporting approximately 30% supporting myself in college to approximately 80% supporting myself in the year that's followed graduation. Throwing out more than half my income in rent, gas, phone service and other random, un-fun expenses is somewhat painful, but much like exercising, no pain, no gain. Yes, paying for things yourself sucks. But being self-reliant (or at least self-relianter) is pretty neat, too. About work: Speaking of responsibilities...work is actually not that bad, guys. I'm lucky enough to have a job I love with people I love at a company I love and I get that not everyone will be able to say the same about their first post-grad job. If you have to work at a job that you only sort of tolerate, or even a job you outright hate, do it, but keep your eye on the prize. Keep working towards doing the thing you love. If that necessitates going to grad school, go to grad school. But whatever you do, please don't take the easy option just because it feels safe. Safety is awesome. I'm a huge fan, personally. But a lot of people our age go to grad school so they can continue to hide from the real world, or take jobs they don't give two shits about because they're afraid they won't find anything better, and I don't think those are roads to a fulfilling career. Something I've learned this year is that your work decisions matter, even now, so don't stumble blindly along the path because you're afraid to blaze a trail. About all that free time: Soon-to-be grads, rejoice! Your life will be yours again before you know it. During the weeks following my graduation, I woke up feeling this crazy sense of freedom that came with the realization that there was really only one thing I had to do each day: Go to work. Compared to the college days I spent going to work, going to class, going to the paper, going to sorority meetings and then coming home to do homework, my schedule suddenly felt empty. What did I do with all my new-found free time? I spent the summer after graduation in a haze of eating out and drinking (10/10, would recommend), but quickly realized that habit was unsustainable long-term. Now I run. I practice yoga. I sit around on my couch when I feel like it. I read for fun. I get a full night's sleep most nights. I cuddle with my cat and sometimes my fiancé, but mostly I just enjoy doing what I want in the moment. It's awesome.About drinking: We're all 21 here. I know what some of you are going to miss about college is all the partying. Don't worry, you will still be able to get drunk and make terrible and embarrassing decisions. (You haven't lived until you've experienced business drunk.*) I have an entire summer full of stories that prove it, if you're still concerned and would like to hear some. Though you might have to get me drunk to get me talkin'. To the Class of 2016: Ya did it, kids. Go enjoy adulthood, you earned it! *Joking aside, please do not drive drunk. It wasn't cool in college and it's not cool when you're a grownup. ", :image_url=>"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/566266fce4b04e4daff1eae1/1461631711141-X075NF26M3L2468LQDOF/11265122_10153050274088423_2423575263976043978_n.jpg?format=500w"},

Spoilers for Orphan Black, season four, episode one lay ahead.", :body=>"It's that time of year, where, once again, I marvel at how one woman can play approximately 2,034,185 characters so distinctly that I consistently forget one actress is portraying all of them. Clone Club is back, y'all! Spoilers for Orphan Black, season four, episode one lay ahead. I've been a fan of Orphan Black since the summer of 2013, after the first season had finished airing. I watched the entire season in less than 36 hours. No ragrets. Tatiana Maslany is just so freaking talented. And sexy. I couldn't look away! I have a big, lesbian crush on her and her mad acting skills. Her acting skills are so mad that each new season of Orphan Black has introduced us to new clones. (We're up to 11 now.) Episode one of season four brings us MK, a clone who's incredibly (and understandably) paranoid. While MK's knowledge of Neolution and backstory is certainly intriguing, the real star of this episode is Beth, whom we've known about since the show's first episode when Sarah watched her step in front of a train.While Beth is definitely livelier in these flashbacks, her story is still as depressing. Her drug problem has been mentioned by characters in previous seasons, but I wouldn't have guessed it was as severe as it's portrayed here. Cosima was not kidding when she told Sarah in season one that, \"Beth was losing it, like, clinically.\" Still, I don't think anyone will be able to see Beth as anything but awesome, given the circumstances. In Beth, we see an incredibly strong character reacting realistically to the weight of the world being placed upon her shoulders. Her suicide has always been a crucial moment for Orphan Black's story—it's what set Sarah's story in motion, after all—but seeing the days (weeks?) leading up to it has only made it resonate that much more. Since the majority of the episode was a flashback to the events more or less leading up to Beth's death, the plot obviously didn't advance much this episode, though in the final minutes, present-day MK contacts Sarah to let her know Kendall Malone (the original source of the LEDA clone DNA) is in danger from Neolution. Or DYAD. Or the Proletheans? Possibly (probably) all three. I will admit that I'm not relishing the prospect of Kendall Malone featuring heavily in the plot moving forward. I'm not sure if it's the entire concept of her, or the execution (Siobhan Sadler's mom? Really? What a wacky coincidence...) but she wasn't my favorite part of season three. I loved that this episode went back to the beginning to focus on Beth, but many fans will be furious that there was no mention of Delphine, who was ambiguously killed at the end of season three. To me, Delphine has never been a particularly engaging character, so I can't say I really missed her in this episode—though for a lot of fans, the anger over Delphine's death may be less about missing Delphine as a character and more about being fed up with another dead lesbian. As understandable as the outcry is, I still continue to love Orphan Black for the same reasons I did when I binged the first season. This show has a palpable suspense and my stomach is in knots the entire viewing, though somehow I still manage to laugh at least a little most episodes. I'm looking forward to seeing how the plot progresses this season, and anticipating that for every question that's answered, another 10 or so will arise.  ", :image_url=>""},

I feel like many great TV shows begin starting a slow decline to mediocrity in the second or third season and become a bitter, fragile shell of their former selves by the fourth, but this season is definitely a rebound for the last—though initially it didn't seem like it would be. First half of season drags a bit, probably because the Underwoods just aren't as awesome apart as they are together, but feels like an entirely new season, even a new show, after Frank is shot. The journalist plotline picks back up (though I love the slow burn). The Conways are introduced in full force (great adversaries, though their portrayal as the young, social media darlings is at times over the top). The Big Data and ICO plotlines—both somewhat dull and heavy-handed, though they speed up the show's pace—begin.House of Cards should be commended on the whole for the job it does juggling the various characters. This season, certain key players were downplayed or written out entirely (RIP Meechum, I barely cared about ye). In hindsight, I was sad about lack of Sharp and Remy but don't actually miss them while watching the show. I did miss Heather Dunbar and am hoping she makes a return, despite being glad she's out of the running. Leanne's character was terribly uninteresting to me, but I was glad they kept the novelist around, because he's kinda hot and it wouldn't be the Underwoods if there weren't some uncomfortable sexual shenanigans going on.My favorite scene this season was easily Frank threatening Kathy by confessing to his various murders before laughing it off. This is Kevin Spacey at his best, and it reminds us just how terrifying Frank is, even if we find ourselves rooting for him time and time again.But enough about Frank and the other minor players. Let's talk about the real star of this show: Mrs. Underwood. I absolutely love the series' slow and steady shift to focus more and more on Claire. Break that fourth wall, baby! I don't recall particularly caring about her much one way or the other in the series' first season, but Claire Underwood has slowly become the queen of my heart. (When she asked Hannah Conway if she regretted having children? Slayed.) Despite its very shaky start, this season not only ended up delivering on its own, it left me excited for the next, which I wouldn't have said about the third season. Underwood & Underwood 2016, y'all. They might run the country to the ground, but they'd have my vote.   ", :image_url=>""},

(Fitting, given that one of his earliest album's is titled Leap Year.) Despite all of the somewhat derisive opinions I'm about to express, I have to point out that going to this concert was 100% my idea and I was no way coerced into attending. Because I am a Hoodie Allen fan. The issue is that I am apparently in the upper range of his fan demographic. Hoodie's Wikipedia page calls his music \"hip hop/alternative hip hop/underground hip hop.\" I would probably term it \"frat boy rap.\" See, I expected a lot of college kids. I was a sophomore when I first heard Hoodie, and I'm not even a year out myself, despite what my sleeping habits and Netflix choices might indicate. What I was not expecting was a bunch of high school kids. My friend/co-concert attendee and I arrived at the venue early, hoping to grab our tickets then head to dinner. It was about 5:30. The doors didn't open until 7:00 and the show didn't start until 8:00, but there was a line. There were event tents. Why in the name of God someone would camp out to see Hoodie Allen in Omaha, Nebraska, I'm not sure, but apparently some people did. Even from across the street, it was apparent that the average age of those lined up was probably 16. Ridiculous.I say this with judgement, but also with understanding. When I was in high school, being as close to the stage as I could possibly get seemed of vital importance to me, too. If I had to stand in line for a few hours, so what? The times, they have a-changed. These days I will gladly sulk by the bar area in back during a concert. Amazingly enough, you can hear the music just as well there! I guess when I was in high school, I somehow thought my concert would be radically different if only I was able to subtly elbow and crowd my way to front, center stage. Maybe the performer would see me in the crowd and recognize me. Maybe they'd pull me up on stage. Maybe we'd fall in love! Or maybe I would at least get passed the elusive concert joint that you always smell all night but never see materialize. I don't know. Anyway, those things have become unimportant to me now. Now I just care about standing in relative comfort in reach of the booze and enjoying the music. This is growing up, people. In the bathroom, after the opener but before Hoodie, I thought for a moment I'd found kindred spirits. I overheard the following:Drunk Girl 1: \"Everyone here is like, NINE.\"Drunk Girl 2: \"Someone's PARENTS dropped them off.\"Drunk Girl 3: \"Oh my God, like, don't you have school tomorrow?\"Drunk Girl 2: \"Yeah, go to bed!\"I found myself nodding in agreement. Yeah, high schoolers, I thought. Don't you have school tomorrow? But then:Drunk Girl ?: \"Do you think he'll sign my titties?\"That was where the drunk girls lost me. And unfortunately for these drunk girls, they were either too old or too not-twig-like for Hoodie to have any interest in their tits, if the girls I did see sneaking off backstage were any indication. The performance itself was great, though a couple things had me turning up my Very Grown Up nose. Firstly, several ladies of the crowd threw their bras up on the stage. Why, ladies? That shit is expensive! And what the hell is he going to do with those, other than maybe add them to the pile? Come on. If you want to show your boobies, that's fine, but put your bra in your back pocket. You're gonna want that back. And then at one point Hoodie threw some cakes into the crowd, apparently in celebration of one of his classic tunes, \"Cake Boy.\" Later, I saw all these girls in the bathroom desperately trying to wash the blue and purple frosting off themselves. Disgusting. The front row is not worth it, y'all. Leaving the show, my friend remarked on the amazing amount of tiny, slutty babies in attendance. Perfectly stated, and Hoodie apparently agrees:Considering that a lot of Hoodie's music is about partying, casual boning and generally refusing to grow up, I probably shouldn't be surprised about the demographic. I should probably be surprised that I even like his music. When I drink these days, I'm not so much getting white girl wasted as I am getting wine mom drunk. There is definitely a difference, the difference being that the latter entails being mostly stationary on the couch and passing out by 11:00, tops. In one of my favorite Hoodie songs, he raps:My friends grew up, they never get drunkThey never wanna stay out lateThey're gonna get jobs, they're gonna pay billsThey're gonna get old and grayI'll never do that, I wanna stay youngDon't wanna fit in, I wanna have funSo if that's okayI don't think I'm ever gonna act my ageI am apparently usually going to act my age, plus another 10 years...but I guess I still appreciate the sentiment. ", :image_url=>"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/566266fce4b04e4daff1eae1/1458064767886-KSNXLSCRYN2JLUS6KV2W/12814392_10153663865453423_4083362607836695560_n.jpg?format=500w"},

I’ve never been the buffest of film buffs, especially not since I discovered the magic of binge watching TV on Netflix, but at least in 2010 I saw three of the Best Picture-nominated films, including the winner (The King’s Speech). If this trend continues, by 2020 I will no longer be taking in any current pop culture. I’ll be spending every Oscar season secluded on my couch, marathoning the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. (Remember when Return of the King won all those awards? Awesome.)Since I can’t comment on any of the films nominated for Academy Awards, here’s what I have to say about the films I did see this year:Avengers: Age of UltronThis was the first movie I saw in 2015—yes, it took me five months into the year to get to a theater. Life is busy, okay? Marvel’s superhero movies tend to be higher-caliber than most and I generally find anything Joss Whedon writes and directs baseline enjoyable, so I predictably really liked the film. It wasn’t as good as The Avengers, but it provided some good lead in for future films in the Marvel universe, so it at least served its purpose of leaving me wanting more.Should you watch it? Provided you are remotely interested in superhero films, yes.Jurassic WorldHaving never seen Jurassic Park, I didn’t really care about seeing Jurassic World, but I went with a friend and we experienced just about every emotion it’s possible to feel during the movie’s two-hour and four-minute run time. Sure, there are lots of issues with some of the film’s basic premises—for example, why would they build a Jurassic World after things at the Jurassic Park went so poorly? How is Bryce Dallas Howard’s character outrunning a velociraptor in that outfit? Still, the film is super entertaining if you can suspend your disbelief, probably due mostly to Chris Pratt, who as usual delivers an insanely fun performance.Should you watch it? Eh, why not?TrainwreckAmy Schumer is a gift to humanity. Trainwreck is, according to Wikipedia, a romantic comedy, but it feels misleading to label it as such, probably because this movie, unlike most romantic comedies, is actually funny. And it’s refreshing to see a woman successfully writing and starring in a comedy, a genre that’s somewhat infamous for its gender inequality. Of course, all of the other performances (Bill Hader as the love interest, Tilda Swinton as the boss, LeBron James as...LeBron James) are great and the jokes hit all the right, albeit raunchy notes. I’m excited to see more from Amy Schumer.Should you watch it? Only if you enjoy laughter.Star Wars: The Force AwakensTechnically, this is an Oscar-nominated film, but it’s nominated for Best Film Editing and Best Sound Editing. In my heart, though, it’s nominated for Best Picture, and, spoiler alert, it won. As a prior Star Wars fan, I went into this film totally prepared to hate it, and I ended up loving it. (So much so that you can read 1,000 more nerdy, spoilery words about it here.) The issue, though, is that now I’ve got Expectations. I am insanely excited for, and therefore set up to be let down for, Episode VIII.Should you watch it? Absolutely. Even if you haven’t seen the other movies. Though as Marshall Eriksen said, “The only people in the universe who haven’t seen Star Wars are the characters in Star Wars and that’s ‘cause they lived ‘em! They lived the Star Wars!”The InternWant to watch something equally sweet and funny? Kind of like a baffled baby animal in film form? Here’s the movie for you, my friend. Despite only having seen this movie a few months ago, I don’t really remember much about it, except that it was a mix of heartwarming and humorous. The premise of a senior citizen intern program at an online fashion service startup is a little weird, but it’s no goofier than, say, a boss forcing her employee to pretend to be her fiancé, or a freaking hot tub time machine.Should you watch it? Yes, unless you’re a Hathahater.Pitch Perfect 2Blah, I say. Maybe I’m still sick of the first one, which was funny enough at first, but after suffering through one too many Pitch Perfect movie nights in college, the jokes started getting tired. Either way, as with many sequels, this film just isn’t as funny as the first, and the pop culture novelty of acapella as a whole has worn a little thin.Should you watch it? It depends how bored you are. This movie is “well, there’s nothing else on”-level quality.Inside OutInside Out is the closest film to a Best Picture nominated movie I’ve seen, as it’s nominated for Best Animated Feature. This movie is the latest in a string of critically-acclaimed Pixar movies, and it’s been praised for tackling a such a conceptual subject as a kid’s movie. (Though at this point, I suspect Pixar is realizing its audience is just as much adults as it is children.) While it’s definitely unlike any Pixar movie before it, I think it might have been a bit over-hyped, or perhaps the little emotions running around up in my brain just aren’t as lively as other viewers’, because I didn’t experience the intense feelings that a lot of audiences claimed to while watching. Should you watch it? Yeah, but it’s no Toy Story 3. Post originally appeared on Firespring culture blog 02-17-16. ", :image_url=>""},

Please do not feel upset or judged. I 100% support every couple's right to plan the wedding they want, even if I think that wedding is boring and/or tacky. As long as you're happy, your wedding was perfect. After all, it's your Special Day. And this is what you can expect if you're taking part in my Special Day: There will be no cutesy wedding hashtag. These were okay at first, but we as a society have really taken them too far. Our wedding hashtag is #HannahAndSeth. Or you could just forego the hashtag entirely. There will be a professional photographer to capture the stuff we really care about; I'm not super concerned about missing any of the selfies you take with the other guests. And there will absolutely not be a theme, unless you consider \"getting married\" a theme. God is not invited to the wedding. Sorry. The fiancé and I aren't religious and our wedding will be a reflection of that. We respect the faiths of our friends and family, but please keep any concerns about our immortal souls to yourselves; we're not trying to discuss our possible eternal damnation with you on our Special Day. What does a heathen wedding ceremony even look like? Other than short? We're honestly not entirely sure yet. We went a liberal arts college and at least three-fourths of our friends participated in music extracurricularly, so there will be a lot of live music during the ceremony. There will be readings, probably. There will not, however, be any cheesy candle-lighting/sand-pouring business because I think it's anticlimactic. Mostly we're just going to say I do and then start drinking. Babies are super not invited to the wedding. Because they cry. Always. I have never been to a wedding ceremony that was free from the screech of an infant. It infuriates me when it happens at other peoples' nuptials and I am not about to have it at mine. Note that the \"must be this tall to ride\" age is TBD. Seth said 18 months; I said five years old. (I don't have a great handle on the child development timeline.) Ultimately, if you are not reasonably certain your progeny will be non-disruptive, said progeny is not allowed. Get a babysitter. We're skipping the reception line. I dread being at a wedding where I only know half of the couple, but I feel like I have to hug and congratulate each as if I'm actually friends with both of them. It's even worse when you're there as a plus-one and you really don't know the couple at all. I intend to spare any of the groom's friends I barely know and any plus-ones who I've hardly met the mutual discomfort of our forced interaction. If you are someone who cares about hugging one or both of us, we will make that happen on our own time.I am not a DIY bride. Pinterest brides, I hate you 'cause I ain't you. If you can make hand-drawn signs and mason jars work for you, more power to ya. But I am not about it. Despite my best attempts to be crafty, my entire life has been a series of Pinterest fails, even before Pinterest existed. Do not expect to be wowed by my wedding decor. I am going to try my best to give my wedding the enchanted forest aesthetic I've always dreamed of, but I might just throw some tealights on the tables and call it good.Free booze for all. It should go without saying, but. Planned reception activities will be minimal. A couple of the standard dances and a toast or two. Maybe a bouquet/garter toss, but that's about it. We're not at our reception to play the Newlywed Game, we're there to be newlyweds. You're sure as hell not at our reception to watch us play the Newlywed Game, you're there to eat our free food and drink our free booze. We get that. If you are invited to my wedding, it is because I like you, and, therefore, will not hold you hostage for hours as you watch my wedding party do a 15-minute, badly choreographed dance to the past year's DJ Earworm mashup. (However, my sorority sisters and I will be dancing to Paradise By the Dashboard Lights later in the night, in accordance with tradition and to Seth's chagrin. Gentlemen, please have your eye rolls at the ready.) There will be some dope dessert. Ultimately, I will measure the success of my wedding the same way I measure the success most events: by how much pastry I end up consuming.  ", :image_url=>""},

So it's fitting that my binge watch this past week was Marvel's Jessica Jones on Netflix. (Be warned all ye who read below: Mild spoilers.)Marvel as a brand is just so on point. I'm a causal fan, with no real familiarity with the comic books, just a working knowledge based off articles I've read relating those plotlines to the corresponding movies, but I have enjoyed every Marvel movie I've watched (or, in the case of Thor: The Dark World, at least been moderately entertained by). After the first Iron Man, I watched most of the Avengers' solo films, my love for the franchise solidifying after seeing the gang all together in the first Avengers film. Guardians of the Galaxy did not interest me at all when I saw the previews, but I saw it anyway and, as per usual, had an incredibly pleasant viewing experience. Essentially, I really trust that Marvel's product will be quality. While I'm salty that there has been no Black Widow origin/solo movie (because no, I don't give two shits about Ant Man, no matter who they get to play him), Marvel is really earning back some feminism points, at least in my book, with Jessica Jones. The show's lead, the titular Jessica, is an ex-superhero who spends her days as a private investigator who's dealing poorly with her PTSD by drinking it away, to varying levels of success. Jessica and her adopted sister, Trish, give us an awesome portrayal of strong female friendship, and Jessica herself shows us what a lead, female anti-hero looks like—which, for those of you wondering, is pure, unadulterated awesome. Watching Krysten Ritter as Jessica is kind of trippy, since I've only seen her in Gilmore Girls and other small, somewhat silly roles. Seeing her play a world-weary alcoholic badass with superhuman strength is a surprise, but in the best way possible. Speaking of awesome performances, let's give two thumbs way, way up for David Tennant. While I know other nerds love him from his role as the Tenth Doctor, I only know him from his quick stint as Barty Crouch, Jr. in the fourth Harry Potter film. His performance as Kilgrave, the show's villain, is excellent. Between his acting and the brilliant writing, I found myself, over the course of the show, moving from fearing and hating the character in the first several episodes to almost rooting for him (and the relationship he seeks with Jessica) in the middle episodes. This, I think, is representative of the temptation to give in to an abuser. But kudos to the screenwriters: Ultimately, the narrative won't leave viewers with a desire to let Kilgrave off the hook, even in light of his seemingly tragic backstory.  As is standard for Marvel, the show tackles gritty moral issues that you probably won't see Superman or Batman touching. And the best part about Jessica Jones is that these issues are often unique to the female experience. One of the coolest aspects of this show is the conversation it's inspiring. Case in point/shameless pseudo-self-promotion: Check out The Parlor Podcast, hosted by my fiancé and one of his friends. I've only listened to their first Jessica Jones episode, but that's just because I was too busy not denying myself the pleasure of binge watching the entire show to listen to the second. In the first, and, hopefully, subsequent podcasts, these two fellas have some great feminist conversation. Also, my fiancé admits he was wrong in an argument we had to the Internet-at-large, so I know it's real.If you're wondering if you should watch Jessica Jones, I've got a little litmus test for you:If you answered yes to even one of the above, it's time to begin your binge. ", :image_url=>""},

That has both nothing and everything to do with what I'm about to tell you.", :body=>" About two months ago, I got hit by a car while I was out running. That same night, just an hour or so later, one of my best friends and college roommates texted me. She was going to Taiwan after Christmas to visit another best friend and roommate of ours who has been living in Taipei since July as a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant. (This post really took a turn, didn’t it?) I’d thought about visiting Krista in Taiwan before, but prior to almost being straight-up run over, the thought had never translated to anything approaching a real plan. Nothing like a near-death experience to really put your priorities in perspective! The next day, I told Mackenzie yes, I’d go with her. And a week after that, we booked our tickets. ('Cause FEMALE FRIENDSHIPS, yo.)We’ve been back from our trip for about two weeks now, and I’ve been struggling to write about the experience. Normally, I’d just talk about the highlights of a vacation. The issue is that the entire trip was a highlight...of my life. That said, here are the highlights of the highlights:Beef noods were delicious. Taiwan beer was not, unless you think Natty Light is delicious. Mackenzie and I survived a total of 18 hours in flight, there and back. Shoutout to the real in-air MVPs: Plane booze and sleeping pills. We ate with chopsticks for every meal.We ate a lot of meals. Luckily I got full really fast because eating with chopsticks, when you don't really know how, takes forever. This, combined with walking everywhere, is what I'm patenting as the \"American Fatties in Taiwan\" weight loss plan.   On Wednesdays, we go to temples. (Four, to be exact.) We got up at 6 a.m.—the day after our arrival, I might add—and climbed a mountain. (The summit of which was perpetually 100 meters away.)We saw prayer hour at Longshan Temple. I don't have any funny commentary about this because even I am not so crass at to try to turn peoples' legitimate religious practice into a snappy zinger. (At least not on the record. Maybe chat me up when I'm kind of tipsy at the bar.)  I love cats. I love every kind of cat. Krista introduced Mackenzie and I to dan bing, which I have craved every day since returning. Oh, dan bing. How I miss your eggy-cheesy-flakey goodness. We spent hours sifting through adorable, cheap clothes at night markets and I drove my friends slowly insane as I drug them along on my quest to find the perfect case for my new iPhone. We got our hair cut at Cruxx H. Studio, a salon that lets you hold cats while you get your hairs did. Hair, barber, cafe, meow indeed. Mackenzie and I watched Krista tell her fifth graders that they can be in the kitchen, but not in the chicken. And we got stared at by lots of tiny humans. Teaching 10-year-olds English must be a very special kind of hell.Jokes about my blatant dislike of children aside, I really am proud of my friend. Much climb, so mountain, wow. We climbed another, steeper mountain. At the top of which I screamed, “I FEEL ALIVE AS FUCK!”Then we climbed a mountain that made the mountain I just climbed look like a tiny baby mountain. (Those mountains were actually crags known as Loving Mother and Dutiful Son.)We sang our hearts out at KTV. Three people singing karaoke in a room with only each other does not necessarily sound fun, but when you’re with people you can laugh with, it’s the best time in the world. Also, you haven't lived until you've scream-sung \"I'll Make Love To You\" to a music video of 90s white people looking at each other meaningfully. I went from one life-and-death experience to another and I'm apparently stoked about it. I’d previously had zero interest in traveling to any country in Asia, but Taiwan sure did school me. It was beautiful, and I’d heartily recommend visiting. Of course, if you can explore the country with your best friends, that’s just an added bonus. Not to get all Dirty Dancing on this post, but I really did have the time of my life, and I really do owe it all to them. And also the person who hit me with their car, I guess.  The moral of the story is sometimes you just need to get run over a little bit to have an awesome adventure. Or something. Carpe diem, my friends. ", :image_url=>"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/566266fce4b04e4daff1eae1/1453347250235-45LACMMWI7HU57T820EL/image-asset.jpeg?format=500w"},

Wearing Birkenstocks with socks is embarrassing but acceptably so. 3. “Africa” by Toto is the ultimate karaoke song.4. The most important aspect of feminism is female friendship. Some elaboration on that last one: The right to vote, to equal pay, to safe and legal abortions, to be hairy are all important, but, as a woman, your support of these things really falls flat if you don’t support other women that you actually know and interact with. To women and men alike, if you ever hear a woman say that she “doesn’t get along with other girls” because they’re jealous, or too much drama or too high maintenance: RUN. That woman is, as a person, a big ol’ turd. Because while some girls do get jealous of other girls, cause drama or have high maintenance tendencies, lots of girls don’t. Really, women have a variety of personalities. They have a variety of interests. (Women: They’re people, just like us!) Some of those personalities and interests won’t be compatible with those of other women…but that doesn’t mean that they’re not compatible with any other woman, at all, ever, in the entire world. If a woman is saying that all other women are the problem? She’s the common denominator. She is the problem. Ladies, I’m not telling you to disown the dudes in your lives (though, just sayin’, if all your friends think your current paramour sucks, he probably does). But I am telling you that friendship with other chicks cannot be replaced by friendship or romance with guys. Female friendship is just so beautiful. I’m talking the kind of female friendship that comes after listening to another woman agonize about her love life for hours at a time. It comes from getting drunk together, on vodka out in downtown bars wearing something kind of skanky and on wine in the comfort of one of your homes while lounging in sweats. It comes from sharing that you’re insecure about where you are in life, whether that’s in terms of money or love or career or geographical location. When I joined a sorority, I became sisters with several girls who said that they didn’t have girl friends in high school. The most beautiful thing in the world was watching them form friendships—best friendships—with other sisters or myself. Living with seven other women during my junior and senior years of college taught me the importance of being friends with other women. It wasn’t always fun or easy. There were fights over who said what about who and who doesn’t like whose boyfriend and why is that bitch always leaving her hair in the shower, but the pain of those moments pales in comparison to the pure contentment I found in the times we’d stay in all day without pants on and order in Chinese food while watching Law and Order: Special Victims Unit, or the Sunday and Monday nights we randomly went to the bar and played “Africa” (the ultimate karaoke song, in case you forgot) on the jukebox.My gal pals have sat with me while I sobbed because some guy was an ass. They’ve given me rides home when I was drunk and brought me soup when I was sick. They’ve travelled 14 hours in a plane with me and they’ve watched old animated movies with me while we laughed so hard at them we cried. They’ve loaned me money when my car got towed because I accidentally parked in a tow zone and was too broke to pay the fee right away. They’ve gone out to eat with me and stayed at the restaurant talking for hours after. They’ve made me a better person. Sometimes, especially if your soul is as back as mine, it’s hard to be happy for others when you’re not getting what you want and it’s hard to be consoling when everything is going great for you. But this support and sympathy is what I’ve gained through my female friendships, and it’s what I’ve learned to give in return. To all my lady friends: It's gonna a lot to drag me away from yooou. ", :image_url=>""},

Here's my review, by which I really mean rambling thoughts. Warning: Herein there be super duper huge major spoilers and a whole lotta feels.", :body=>"Like most of the entire planet, I saw the new Star Wars film this weekend. Here's my review, by which I really mean rambling thoughts. Warning: Herein there be super duper huge major spoilers and a whole lotta feels.Holy parallelism, Batman. The parallels to the original film, Star Wars: A New Hope, are strong with this one. While this has been possibly the biggest critique of the film, I personally loved the parallels. Some of them were obvious (I mean, they basically destroyed the Death Star via a trench run for the THIRD TIME), but a lot of them were expertly subtle. For me, all of them hit exactly the right note. Rey's story mirrored Luke's, just as Poe's did Leia's and Finn's did Han's. Speaking of Han...while it's not exactly surprising he's the Obi-Wan in this film, given Harrison Ford's attitude about participating in the Star Wars franchise, it was still absolutely devastating to see him taken out of any future movies, especially by his own son. From the moment Leia told him to bring Kylo Ren/Ben home, I had a sick feeling he was a goner that only increased when he went back into the base with Chewie. And yet I still sat squirming in my seat during his and Vader 2.0's scene, naively hoping that maybe the wayward Solo would change his mind and return to the light this movie in a bizarre twist. That right there is some movie magic! Still, I'm sure Ford/Han will be greatly missed in the subsequent movies. Han Solo was already an iconic character and fan favorite, and Ford delivered a great reprise performance, complete with arguably the funniest line in the whole film: \"That's not how the Force works!\" But, as that entire exchange with Finn about his previous stormtrooper duties (sanitation—I'm still laughing) proved, he really did what he was meant to do: Shepherd in the new cast to blend the old and new in a way I really doubt Carrie Fisher or Mark Hamill would have been able to do.  While Fisher did a fine job, I'm hoping we see more of Leia in the next two movies so I can really judge her repeat performance. Carrie Fisher is an amazing lady, but she sounds like she's smoked a pack a day since Jedi stopped filming (which she probably has) and overall I felt very neutral about her appearance in The Force Awakens. Same with Mark Hamill's threeish minutes back as Luke Skywalker, though that's to be expected. I was afraid we wouldn't see him at all, so getting a glimpse him back in the role was tantalizing, as I'm sure was intended.Confession time: Probably the nerdiest thing I've ever done is read Star Wars expanded universe books. Specifically the New Jedi Order series and those that followed (Legacy of the Force, Fate of the Jedi). These series were all about Luke, Leia and Han and their children, chronicling events that took place post-Return of the Jedi. Once the Star Wars franchise was sold to Disney, all of these books were declared non-canonical. (It's now being called \"Legends.\") As someone who invested hundreds of hours and dollars in the expanded universe, I had a lot of mixed feelings when I found out the new film was doing away with it all. On the one hand, I thought it was kind of shitty that these movies wouldn't follow the established storyline, since, you know, it was all...established. At the same time, I did feel some stirrings of hope, because to be fair, the established storyline and the characters therein were not great. Definitely mediocre at best.So as to not form any opinions before seeing the film, I purposely learned as little as possible about the new characters that were in a sense replacing the ones I'd been familiar with for years. After meeting Rey, Finn, Poe and Kylon Ren, I'm admitting that it was indeed a good idea for them to do away with Jaina, Jacen and Anakin Solo and Ben Skywalker.Finn and Poe are great characters and well-acted, but I'm most enamored with Rey. Movies frequently feature a \"strong female,\" but their roles exist only to further the stories of the male characters (*cough* Black Widow *cough). Amazingly, Rey's role goes beyond being a badass with one-liners about how she doesn't need her hand held. She is the Luke of this new trilogy, and she is the new cast member the story will truly take shape around. She's the one whose parentage is being intensely speculated about. She's the one who has crazy powers and goes to find Luke. While it seemed at first like Finn would be the character embarking on the Hero's Journey, Rey's besting of Kylo Ren, not once, but twice, proves that it's her all the way. Hell. Effing. Yeah. On the subject of the new big bad: My personal jury is out for now on the First Order and Supreme Leader Snoke (at this point, I'm hoping he's a puppet or lackey for a more impressive evil-doer), but I did especially appreciate Kylo Ren/Ben Solo, partially because when did I start finding Adam Driver so sexy?! but mostly because to me it seemed the filmmakers borrowed from the expanded universe. While this Ben is Leia's son and not Luke's, it's still a nice nod. The bigger similarity is that in the Legacy of the Force series, Jacen Solo falls to the dark side, like his grandfather before him. Because of this, I found the concept of an evil Solo son not only believable, but pleasantly familiar. I also felt like his little temper tantrums were a great nod to fan jokes about Anakin Skywalker's hissy fits—which, in the prequels, we were supposed to take seriously; in The Force Awakens, it's something to chuckle at, which is incredibly refreshing. In fact, the entire movie had a good deal of humor, while still managing to be epic and heartbreaking. It felt very Whedon-esque to me, though it still retained some of the classic Star Wars cheesiness. Though it's true that I went in with no-to-low expectations in order to be pleasantly surprised if the film didn't suck, I was more than pleasantly surprised, because the film was awesome. I encourage old fans to check it out, as I'm sure they will at least enjoy if not full-on love it. And I'm excited to see all the new fans The Force Awakens awakens. P.S.: If you pride yourself on being someone who has never seen Star Wars and doesn't care about it...I'm not mad about it, but I don't think you're a special snowflake. I just think you're lame.  ", :image_url=>""},
  {:title=>"Things I Wish I Was", :date=>"2015-12-16", :summary=>"Lately I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about myself. Actually, I’m always thinking a lot about myself (lots of introspection to be found here!), but the focus lately has been my strengths and weaknesses.", :body=>"Wish I was a little bit tallerI wish I was a ballerI wish I had a girl who looked goodI would call her—Skee-Lo, “I Wish” Lately I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about myself. Actually, I’m always thinking a lot about myself (lots of introspection to be found here!), but the focus lately has been my strengths and weaknesses. I wish I was deliberative. I want to make a decision and Goddammit I want to do it now. It’s not that I don’t think about my actions—I just don’t always think about them long enough. I guess I’ve always felt like I’m destined to make the decision I’m going to make, regardless of how long I spend deep in though, mulling over pro and con lists.I wish I was in the moment. Due to my mild generalized anxiety disorder, I’m constantly fretting about the future. I’m always planning my next move, and I worry about future details ranging from exactly when my friends and I are meeting at the bar to the possibility of my fiancé possibly getting a job that’s not currently a commutable distance at some point five-plus years down the road. Living like this is incredibly stressful for me and annoying to others. Sorry, loved ones, for my lack of chill. I wish I was an includer. I want everything I’m involved in to feel exclusive. I do not take well to outsiders. While I have several friends who are constantly asking, “Should we invite Person I’m Sort of Friends With That You’ve Met Once to this?” and ballooning our one-on-one hangout to a seven person shindig, I can’t think of an instance when I’ve been that person. While my includer friends make me cranky at least once a month, I’m ultimately always thankful that I got to meet Person They’re Sort of Friends With That I’ve Met Once again because Person They’re Sort of Friends With That I’ve Met Once is actually pretty cool. Who knew?!I wish I was kinder. I am not a nice person. I’m not especially mean to people, but it’s just not in my nature to frequently compliment or reassure others. Smiling at strangers and acquaintances isn’t instinctual for me. I don’t have it in me to fake an interest in someone else’s life. I do have a filter, but if I’m going to say something, it’s going to be honest and there’s at least a 25% chance that it comes off as harsh. I’ve been called intimidating, which is impressive, considering I’m barely over five feet tall and have the voice of a rodent with a head cold. Dear world, I promise I’m not an unfeeling person, I just do a great imitation of one. I was I was more humble. I’m so into myself that I’m really afraid people will realize how into myself I am. I know it’s not an attractive quality. I feel like my superiority complex sometimes gives me an inferiority complex. The question in my mind is never, “Will I be good enough?” It’s “Will other people realize that I’m the best?” It’s not that I think I’m perfect. It’s just that I think I’m awesome when it comes to some specific things, and when someone doubts it I say it’s them, not me. Sometimes I think I really need to work on these things. I need to smile way more and ask about everyone’s kids like I give a shit. I need to be more welcoming to others, like I’d want them to be to me. I need to not make snap decisions. I need to stop thinking about what I’m going to do in the event of [insert your own unlikely tragedy here]. I need to stop being so obsessed with myself. But then I think, as much as these are things that I wish I was, I still like the things I am. I like that I’m a doer. I like that I’m direct and confident. I like that my friendship is hard-won (I mean, you have to get over me trying to avoid getting to know you, then you have to deal with me appearing to not give a shit about you until I actually get to know you). It’s probably all just part of my clinical narcissism, but ultimately, while I’m trying to be kinder, more inclusive, more thoughtful, less fretful and less self absorbed, I’ve mostly come to terms with who I am. And, surprise, surprise, I still think I’m pretty great. ", :image_url=>""},
